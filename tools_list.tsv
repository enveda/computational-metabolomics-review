CIDMD	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Compound identification is at the center of metabolomics, usually by comparing experimental mass spectra against library spectra. However, most compounds are not commercially available to generate library spectra. Hence, for such compounds, MS/MS spectra need to be predicted. Machine learning and heuristic models have largely failed except for lipids. Here, quantum chemistry software can be used to predict mass spectra. However, quantum chemistry predictions for collision induced dissociation (CID) mass spectra in LC-MS/MS are rare. We present the CIDMD (Collision-Induced Dissociation via Molecular Dynamics) framework to model CID-based MS/MS spectra. It uses first-principles molecular dynamics (MD) to simulate the physical process of molecular collisions in CID tandem mass spectrometry. First, molecular ions are constructed at specific protonation sites. Using density functional theory, these protonated ions are targeted by argon collider gas atoms at user-specified velocities. Subsequent bond breakages are simulated over time for at least 1,000 fs. Each simulation is repeated multiple times from various collisional directions. Fragmentations are accumulated over those repeated collisions to generate CIDMD in silico mass spectra. Twelve small metabolites (<205 Da) were selected to test the accuracy of this framework in comparison to experimental MS/MS spectra. When testing different protomers, collider velocities, number of simulations, simulation time and impact factor b cutoffs, we yielded 261 predicted mass spectra. These in silico spectra resulted in entropy similarity scores of an average 624 ± 189 for all 261 spectra compared to their corresponding experimental spectra, which improved to 828 ± 77 when using optimal parameters of the most probable protomers for 12 molecules. With increasing molecular mass, higher velocities achieved better results. Similarly, different protomers showed large differences in fragmentation; hence, with increasing numbers of protomers and tautomers, the average CIDMD prediction accuracy decreased. Mechanistic details showed that specific fragment ions can be produced from different protomers via multiple fragmentation pathways. We propose that CIDMD is a suitable tool to predict mass spectra of small metabolites like produced by the gut microbiome.

MS2Compound	Annotation	Spectrum prediction		Metabolomics is a leading frontier of systems science and biomedical innovation. However, metabolite identification in mass spectrometry (MS)-based global metabolomics investigations remains a formidable challenge. Moreover, lack of comprehensive spectral databases hinders accurate identification of compounds in global MS-based metabolomics. Creating experiment-derived metabolite spectral libraries tailored to each experiment is labor-intensive. Therefore, predicted spectral libraries could serve as a better alternative. User-friendly tools are much needed, as the currently available metabolomic analysis tools do not offer adequate provision for users to create or choose context-specific databases. Here, we introduce the MS2Compound, a metabolite identification tool, which can be used to generate a custom database of predicted spectra using the Competitive Fragmentation Modeling-ID (CFM-ID) algorithm, and identify metabolites or compounds from the generated database. The database generator can create databases of the model/context/species used in the metabolomics study. The MS2Compound is also powered with mS-score, a scoring function for matching raw fragment spectra to a predicted spectra database. We demonstrated that mS-score is robust in par with dot product and hypergeometric score in identifying metabolites using benchmarking datasets. We evaluated and highlight here the unique features of the MS2Compound by a re-analysis of a publicly available metabolomic dataset (MassIVE id: MSV000086784) for a complex traditional drug formulation called Triphala. In conclusion, we believe that the omics systems science and biomedical research and innovation community in the field of metabolomics will find the MS2Compound as a user-friendly analysis tool of choice to accelerate future metabolomic analyses.

CRB-FCC	Annotation	Molecular formula prediction		LC-MS-based nontargeted analysis is essential for identifying key chemicals in real-world samples. A significant technical bottleneck, however, arises in resolving the structures of unknown chemicals from their mass spectra. This challenge is exacerbated by the limited information available in existing databases and the poor quality of the acquired mass spectra. To address these issues, we developed the Fragmental Chain Characterization (FCC) method, which assigns formulas to unknown compounds based on their mass spectra. When integrated with the Chromatographic Retention Behavior (CRB) approach, the CRB-FCC method enables the identification of the same compound across different samples, leveraging consistent retention times and assigned formulas, even when sampling conditions cause significant variations in mass spectra. The CRB-FCC method is validated using a large set of 1,475 chemical standards. In comparison to conventional annotation methods, which rely on mass spectral matching, CRB-FCC has shown the ability to accurately annotate compounds even when their mass spectra are of poor quality or absent from the database. As a case in point, we combined CRB-FCC and NMR characterization to successfully identify unknown yellow-hue impurities in biosynthesized plastics sourced from local industrial sources, addressing a key barrier to their practical applications. We anticipate that CRB-FCC, a standardized protocol for data acquisition and interpretation in nontargeted analysis, will accelerate its adoption across both academia and industry.

FSA	Annotation	Molecular formula prediction		Introduction  Metabolite identification remains a bottleneck in untargeted liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS) metabolomics studies, especially when the underlying metabolite is not found in the tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) databases. Objective  A new approach, formula subset analysis (FSA), was developed to effectively rank the chemical formula candidates for an MS/MS spectrum. Methods  This approach first computes mother-daughter relationships (MDRs) among possible formulas of fragments and the precursor under a given mass tolerance and then determines the characteristic fragments (CFs) that only present one MDR with the precursor and other fragments. Subsequently, the precursor formula candidates are ranked by the scores derived from the number of MDRs. Results  A numerical study using seven large datasets totaling 30357 MS/MS spectra from 6612 metabolites consisting of C, H, O, N, S, and P showed that FSA ranked the correct chemical formula as the top-1 candidate for a metabolite in 84.50% of the cases and in the top-5 candidates in 97.20% of the cases. The average processing time for each spectrum was 0.033 seconds. Moreover, FSA does not require training data, not rely on MS/MS databases, can be applied to a wide mass range, and can be quickly expanded with more chemical elements and formulas to identify different chemical species. Conclusions  FSA has not utilized structural information yet and therefore its accuracy may not be competitive with some of the state-of-the-art identification tools. However, its advantages in speed, expandability, and applicability, make it suitable for prescreening candidates in untargeted LC-MS metabolomics studies.

IDSL.UFA	Annotation	Molecular formula prediction		Untargeted liquid chromatography/high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/HRMS) assays in metabolomics and exposomics aim to characterize the small molecule chemical space in a biospecimen. To gain maximum biological insights from these data sets, LC/HRMS peaks should be annotated with chemical and functional information including molecular formula, structure, chemical class, and metabolic pathways. Among these, molecular formulas may be assigned to LC/HRMS peaks through matching theoretical and observed isotopic profiles (MS1) of the underlying ionized compound. For this, we have developed the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics–United Formula Annotation (IDSL.UFA) R package. In the untargeted metabolomics validation tests, IDSL.UFA assigned 54.31–85.51% molecular formula for true positive annotations as the top hit and 90.58–100% within the top five hits. Molecular formula annotations were also supported by tandem mass spectrometry data. We have implemented new strategies to (1) generate formula sources and their theoretical isotopic profiles, (2) optimize the formula hits ranking for the individual and aligned peak lists, and (3) scale IDSL.UFA-based workflows for studies with larger sample sizes. Annotating the raw data for a publicly available pregnancy metabolome study using IDSL.UFA highlighted hundreds of new pregnancy-related compounds and also suggested the presence of chlorinated perfluorotriether alcohols (Cl-PFTrEAs) in human specimens. IDSL.UFA is useful for human metabolomics and exposomics studies where we need to minimize the loss of biological insights in untargeted LC/HRMS data sets. The IDSL.UFA package is available in the R CRAN repository https://cran.r-project.org/package=IDSL.UFA. Detailed documentation and tutorials are also provided at www.ufa.idsl.me.

COSMIC	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval		Untargeted metabolomics experiments rely on spectral libraries for structure annotation, but, typically, only a small fraction of spectra can be matched. Previous in silico methods search in structure databases but cannot distinguish between correct and incorrect annotations. Here we introduce the COSMIC workflow that combines in silico structure database generation and annotation with a confidence score consisting of kernel density P value estimation and a support vector machine with enforced directionality of features. On diverse datasets, COSMIC annotates a substantial number of hits at low false discovery rates and outperforms spectral library search. To demonstrate that COSMIC can annotate structures never reported before, we annotated 12 natural bile acids. The annotation of nine structures was confirmed by manual evaluation and two structures using synthetic standards. In human samples, we annotated and manually validated 315 molecular structures currently absent from the Human Metabolome Database. Application of COSMIC to data from 17,400 metabolomics experiments led to 1,715 high-confidence structural annotations that were absent from spectral libraries.

LC-MS2Struct	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval	Yes	Structural annotation of small molecules in biological samples remains a key bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics, despite rapid progress in predictive methods and tools during the past decade. Liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry, one of the most widely used analysis platforms, can detect thousands of molecules in a sample, the vast majority of which remain unidentified even with best-of-class methods. Here we present LC-MS2Struct, a machine learning framework for structural annotation of small-molecule data arising from liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS2) measurements. LC-MS2Struct jointly predicts the annotations for a set of mass spectrometry features in a sample, using a novel structured prediction model trained to optimally combine the output of state-of-the-art MS2 scorers and observed retention orders. We evaluate our method on a dataset covering all publicly available reversed-phase LC-MS2 data in the MassBank reference database, including 4,327 molecules measured using 18 different LC conditions from 16 contributors, greatly expanding the chemical analytical space covered in previous multi-MS2 scorer evaluations. LC-MS2Struct obtains significantly higher annotation accuracy than earlier methods and improves the annotation accuracy of state-of-the-art MS2 scorers by up to 106%. The use of stereochemistry-aware molecular fingerprints improves prediction performance, which highlights limitations in existing approaches and has strong implications for future computational LC-MS2 developments.

VInSMoC	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval		Mass spectrometry is a widely used method for the identification of molecules in complex samples. Current tools for database search of experimental spectra against libraries of molecules are not scalable. Moreover, these tools are often limited to known molecules and only perform an exact search. Here, to address this, we introduce Variable Interpretation of Spectrum–Molecule Couples, or VInSMoC, a mass spectral database search algorithm for the identification of variants of molecules. VInSMoC removes some false identifications by estimating the statistical significance of matches between spectra and molecular structures. Benchmarking VInSMoC in a search of 483 million spectra from GNPS against 87 million molecules from PubChem and COCONUT revealed 43,000 known molecules and 85,000 variants that were previously unreported. VInSMoC further facilitates identifying putative microbial biosynthesis pathways of promothiocin B and depsidomycin in Streptomyces bellus and Streptomyces sp. F-2747, respectively.

BAM	Annotation	Molecular networking		Although untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics is crucial for understanding life’s molecular underpinnings, its effectiveness is hampered by low annotation rates of the generated tandem mass spectra. To address this issue, we introduce a novel data-driven approach, Biotransformation-based Annotation Method (BAM), that leverages molecular structural similarities inherent in biochemical reactions. BAM operates by applying biotransformation rules to known “anchor” molecules, which exhibit high spectral similarity to unknown spectra, thereby hypothesizing and ranking potential structures for the corresponding “suspect” molecule. BAM’s effectiveness is demonstrated by its success in annotating query spectra in a global molecular network comprising hundreds of millions of spectra. BAM was able to assign correct molecular structures to 24.2% of examined anchor-suspect cases, thereby demonstrating remarkable advancement in metabolite annotation.

ChemWalker	Annotation	Molecular networking		Motivation Annotation of the mass signals is still the biggest bottleneck for the untargeted mass spectrometry analysis of complex mixtures. Molecular networks are being increasingly adopted by the mass spectrometry community as a tool to annotate large-scale experiments. We have previously shown that the process of propagating annotations from spectral library matches on molecular networks can be automated using Network Annotation Propagation (NAP). One of the limitations of NAP is that the information for the spectral matches is only propagated locally, to the first neighbor of a spectral match. Here, we show that annotation propagation can be expanded to nodes not directly connected to spectral matches using random walks on graphs, introducing the ChemWalker python library. Results Similarly to NAP, ChemWalker relies on combinatorial in silico fragmentation results, performed by MetFrag, searching biologically relevant databases. Departing from the combination of a spectral network and the structural similarity among candidate structures, we have used MetFusion Scoring function to create a weight function, producing a weighted graph. This graph was subsequently used by the random walk to calculate the probability of ‘walking’ through a set of candidates, departing from seed nodes (represented by spectral library matches). This approach allowed the information propagation to nodes not directly connected to the spectral library match. Compared with NAP, ChemWalker has a series of improvements, on running time, scalability and maintainability and is available as a standalone python package.

ConCISE	Annotation	Molecular networking		Recent developments in molecular networking have expanded our ability to characterize the metabolome of diverse samples that contain a significant proportion of ion features with no mass spectral match to known compounds. Manual and tool-assisted natural annotation propagation is readily used to classify molecular networks; however, currently no annotation propagation tools leverage consensus confidence strategies enabled by hierarchical chemical ontologies or enable the use of new in silico tools without significant modification. Herein we present ConCISE (Consensus Classifications of In Silico Elucidations) which is the first tool to fuse molecular networking, spectral library matching and in silico class predictions to establish accurate putative classifications for entire subnetworks. By limiting annotation propagation to only structural classes which are identical for the majority of ion features within a subnetwork, ConCISE maintains a true positive rate greater than 95% across all levels of the ChemOnt hierarchical ontology used by the ClassyFire annotation software (superclass, class, subclass). The ConCISE framework expanded the proportion of reliable and consistent ion feature annotation up to 76%, allowing for improved assessment of the chemo-diversity of dissolved organic matter pools from three complex marine metabolomics datasets comprising dominant reef primary producers, five species of the diatom genus Pseudo-nitzchia, and stromatolite sediment samples.

E-SGMN	Annotation	Molecular networking		The rapid, efficient, and accurate annotation of compounds in complex samples remains a significant challenge in metabolomics. The recently developed Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer (MS) integrates a traditional quadrupole Orbitrap with a novel Astral mass analyzer, providing fast MS/MS scanning speed and high sensitivity. However, existing metabolomics annotation methods have not fully exploited the advanced capabilities of Astral MS. In this study, an enhanced structure-guided molecular networking (E-SGMN) method was developed, which is specifically tailored for the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer (MS). Unlike previous network annotation methods, E-SGMN extracted both previously detected metabolites and those potentially detected by Astral from the metabolome database, enabling more efficient and accurate network construction through structural similarity. E-SGMN expands annotation coverage by accurately improving network size, while minimizing the inclusion of irrelevant compounds, achieving a balance between annotation scale and accuracy. Validation results revealed that Astral-E-SGMN achieved an annotation coverage and accuracy of 76.84% and 78.08%, respectively, for a spiked plasma, significantly outperforming E-SGMN-Q Exactive HF (E-SGMN-QE HF). Notably, 5440 metabolite features from NIST SRM 1950 human plasma were annotated by Astral-E-SGMN, a 3.6-fold increase over QE HF-SGMN. Comparative analyses for six types of typical biological samples demonstrate that E-SGMN-Astral enhanced metabolite annotations by 3.7–44.2 times compared to conventional annotation methods, highlighting E-SGMN’s wider metabolite annotation coverage. This method not only enhances annotation coverage, but also provides a transformative tool for understanding complex biological systems, holding significant potential for life science and clinical medicine.

IIMN	Annotation	Molecular networking		Molecular networking connects mass spectra of molecules based on the similarity of their fragmentation patterns. However, during ionization, molecules commonly form multiple ion species with different fragmentation behavior. As a result, the fragmentation spectra of these ion species often remain unconnected in tandem mass spectrometry-based molecular networks, leading to redundant and disconnected sub-networks of the same compound classes. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop Ion Identity Molecular Networking (IIMN) that integrates chromatographic peak shape correlation analysis into molecular networks to connect and collapse different ion species of the same molecule. The new feature relationships improve network connectivity for structurally related molecules, can be used to reveal unknown ion-ligand complexes, enhance annotation within molecular networks, and facilitate the expansion of spectral reference libraries. IIMN is integrated into various open source feature finding tools and the GNPS environment. Moreover, IIMN-based spectral libraries with a broad coverage of ion species are publicly available.

IMN4NPD	Annotation	Molecular networking		Molecular networking has emerged as a standard approach for natural product (NP) discovery. However, the current pipeline based on molecular networks tends to prioritize larger clusters comprising multiple nodes. To address this issue, we present the integrated molecular networking workflow for NP dereplication (IMN4NPD). This approach not only expedites the rapid dereplication of extensive clusters within the molecular network but also places specific emphasis on self-looped or pairs of nodes, which are often overlooked by the current methods. By amalgamating the outputs from various computational tools, we efficiently dereplicate compounds falling into specific categories and provide annotations for both large cluster nodes and self-looped or pair of nodes within the molecular network. Furthermore, we have incorporated several fundamentally distinct similarity algorithms, namely, Spec2Vec and MS2DeepScore, for constructing the t-SNE network. Through comparison with modified cosine similarity, we have observed that integrating additional diverse spectral similarity measures, the resulting t-SNE network enhanced the ability to dereplicate NPs. Demonstrating the use case of an ethanol extract of Plumula nelumbinis, we illustrate that an integration of multiple computational solutions with IMN4NPD aids the dereplication, especially self-looped nodes, and in the discovery of novel compounds in NPs.

Using MCN, we demonstrate the discovery of novel dipeptide-conjugated bile acids.

MMSA	Annotation	Molecular networking		Molecular networking is a computational mass spectrometry technique used to visualize and connect tandem mass spectra from putatively related molecules to reveal structural relationships. Despite their utility, existing tools for interpreting molecular networks are limited in the ability to easily organize fragmentation patterns within molecular families. We developed an interactive web-based tool, the Multiple Mass Spectral Alignment (MMSA) approach, that enhances the visualization of molecular networks by displaying detailed spectral alignment information among all the spectra in a network component in one visualization. MMSA identifies sets of consensus peaks that contribute to the alignment of multiple tandem mass spectra, offering insights into how structural moieties captured by specific fragments influence the construction of molecular networks. We demonstrate that MMSA facilitates insightful understanding of molecular networks and improves the interpretability of the tandem mass spectra, capturing the chemical modifications or core structures within a molecular family. We envision that the MMSA tool will significantly enhance the ability to interpret molecular networks, with implications for more rapid identification and prioritization of new metabolites for full characterization.

MNA integrates in-silico MS and MS/MS spectra for 467,126 unique NPs, alongside over 597,904 experimental MS/MS spectra of 70,799 distinct NPs. Utilizing forty-seven mass similarity algorithms, MNA reveals intrinsic relationships among metabolomic features. Evaluations with an in-house microbial NP library show that MNA provides superior coverage and accuracy compared to traditional methods. In analyzing Kutzneria viridogrisea's metabolome, MNA efficiently identified six novel aromatic glycosides, derived from the menaquinone pathway. In vitro assays and multi-omics analysis demonstrated that these metabolites scavenge reactive oxidative species and prevent self-toxicity, unveiling a new bacterial survival mechanism and the tool's potential for discovering cryptic metabolites and novel metabolic pathways.

ModiFinder	Annotation	Molecular networking		Untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has become a high-throughput method to measure small molecules in complex samples. One key goal is the transformation of these MS/MS spectra into chemical structures. Computational techniques such as MS/MS library search have enabled the reidentification of known compounds. Analog library search and molecular networking extend this identification to unknown compounds. While there have been advancements in metrics for the similarity of MS/MS spectra of structurally similar compounds, there is still a lack of automated methods to provide site specific information about structural modifications. Here we introduce ModiFinder which leverages the alignment of peaks in MS/MS spectra between structurally related known and unknown small molecules. Specifically, ModiFinder focuses on shifted MS/MS fragment peaks in the MS/MS alignment. These shifted peaks putatively represent substructures of the known molecule that contain the site of the modification. ModiFinder synthesizes this information together and scores the likelihood for each atom in the known molecule to be the modification site. We demonstrate in this manuscript how ModiFinder can effectively localize modifications which extends the capabilities of MS/MS analog searching and molecular networking to accelerate the discovery of novel compounds.

MolNotator	Annotation	Molecular networking		In the context of untargeted metabolomics, molecular networking is a popular and efficient tool which organizes and simplifies mass spectrometry fragmentation data (LC-MS/MS), by clustering ions based on a cosine similarity score. However, the nature of the ion species is rarely taken into account, causing redundancy as a single compound may be present in different forms throughout the network. Taking advantage of the presence of such redundant ions, we developed a new method named MolNotator. Using the different ion species produced by a molecule during ionization (adducts, dimers, trimers, in-source fragments), a predicted molecule node (or neutral node) is created by triangulation, and ultimately computing the associated molecule’s calculated mass. These neutral nodes provide researchers with several advantages. Firstly, each molecule is then represented in its ionization context, connected to all produced ions and indirectly to some coeluted compounds, thereby also highlighting unexpected widely present adduct species. Secondly, the predicted neutrals serve as anchors to merge the complementary positive and negative ionization modes into a single network. Lastly, the dereplication is improved by the use of all available ions connected to the neutral nodes, and the computed molecular masses can be used for exact mass dereplication. MolNotator is available as a Python library and was validated using the lichen database spectra acquired on an Orbitrap, computing neutral molecules for >90% of the 156 molecules in the dataset. By focusing on actual molecules instead of ions, MolNotator greatly facilitates the selection of molecules of interest.

SGMNS	Annotation	Molecular networking		Large-scale metabolite annotation is a bottleneck in untargeted metabolomics. Here, we present a structure-guided molecular network strategy (SGMNS) for deep annotation of untargeted ultra-performance liquid chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomics data. Different from the current network-based metabolite annotation method, SGMNS is based on a global connectivity molecular network (GCMN), which was constructed by molecular fingerprint similarity of chemical structures in metabolome databases. Neighbor metabolites with similar structures in GCMN are expected to produce similar spectra. Network annotation propagation of SGMNS is performed using known metabolites as seeds. The experimental MS/MS spectra of seeds are assigned to corresponding neighbor metabolites in GCMN as their “pseudo” spectra; the propagation is done by searching predicted retention times, MS1, and “pseudo” spectra against metabolite features in untargeted metabolomics data. Then, the annotated metabolite features were used as new seeds for annotation propagation again. Performance evaluation of SGMNS showed its unique advantages for metabolome annotation. The developed method was applied to annotate six typical biological samples; a total of 701, 1557, 1147, 1095, 1237, and 2041 metabolites were annotated from the cell, feces, plasma (NIST SRM 1950), tissue, urine, and their pooled sample, respectively, and the annotation accuracy was >83% with RSD <2%. The results show that SGMNS fully exploits the chemical space of the existing metabolomes for metabolite deep annotation and overcomes the shortcoming of insufficient reference MS/MS spectra.

SIMILE	Annotation	Molecular networking		Interrelating small molecules according to their aligned fragmentation spectra is central to tandem mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics. Current alignment algorithms do not provide statistical significance and compounds that have multiple delocalized structural differences and therefore often fail to have their fragment ions aligned. Here we align fragmentation spectra with both statistical significance and allowance for multiple chemical differences using Significant Interrelation of MS/MS Ions via Laplacian Embedding (SIMILE). SIMILE yields spectral alignment inferred structural connections in molecular networks that are not found with cosine-based scoring algorithms. In addition, it is now possible to rank spectral alignments based on p-values in the exploration of structural relationships between compounds and enhance the chemical connectivity that can be obtained with molecular networking.

AnnoMe	Annotation	Others	Yes	Summary Annotation of MS/MS spectra is a complex task and can be done with human expertise or machine learning models that rely on large spectral and structural databases for training. Often, users want to find novel compounds of a particular compound class they are already familiar with. This requires the classification of detected compounds as 'relevant' (i.e., belonging to the compound class of interest) or not (i.e., 'other'). For such applications, a python-package is presented that allows users to classify their experimental MS/MS spectra, respectively. By leveraging structure-informed embeddings (MS2DeepScore) alongside a curated dataset of 'relevant' and 'other' reference MS/MS spectra, the package enables rapid and accurate prediction of 'relevant' compounds with a series of binary classification models and a majority vote, facilitating exploration of the complex chemical space inherent to LC-HRMS/MS data. The package, named AnnoMe, is presented with the task of predicting prenylated flavonoids for prioritization in natural product discovery.

AnnoSM	Annotation	Others		Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful technology for the structural elucidation of known or unknown small molecules. However, the accuracy of MS-based structure annotation is still limited due to the presence of numerous isomers in complex matrices. There are still challenges in automatically interpreting the fine structure of molecules, such as the types and positions of substituents (substituent modes, SMs) in the structure. In this study, we employed flavones, flavonols, and isoflavones as examples to develop an automated annotation method for identifying the SMs on the parent molecular skeleton based on a characteristic MS/MS fragment ion library. Importantly, user-friendly software AnnoSM was built for the convenience of researchers with limited computational backgrounds. It achieved 76.87% top-1 accuracy on the 148 authentic standards. Among them, 22 sets of flavonoid isomers were successfully differentiated. Moreover, the developed method was successfully applied to complex matrices. One such example is the extract of Ginkgo biloba L. (EGB), in which 331 possible flavonoids with SM candidates were annotated. Among them, 23 flavonoids were verified by authentic standards. The correct SMs of 13 flavonoids were ranked first on the candidate list. In the future, this software can also be extrapolated to other classes of compounds.

IDSL.CSA	Annotation	Others		Poor chemical annotation of high-resolution mass spectrometry data limits applications of untargeted metabolomics datasets. Our new software, the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics─Composite Spectra Analysis (IDSL.CSA) R package, generates composite mass spectra libraries from MS1-only data, enabling the chemical annotation of high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography peaks regardless of the availability of MS2 fragmentation spectra. We demonstrate comparable annotation rates for commonly detected endogenous metabolites in human blood samples using IDSL.CSA libraries versus MS/MS libraries in validation tests. IDSL.CSA can create and search composite spectra libraries from any untargeted metabolomics dataset generated using high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled to liquid or gas chromatography instruments. The cross-applicability of these libraries across independent studies may provide access to new biological insights that may be missed due to the lack of MS2 fragmentation data. The IDSL.CSA package is available in the R-CRAN repository at https://cran.r-project.org/package=IDSL.CSA. Detailed documentation and tutorials are provided at https://github.com/idslme/IDSL.CSA.

Inventa	Annotation	Others		Collections of natural extracts hold potential for the discovery of novel natural products with original modes of action. The prioritization of extracts from collections remains challenging due to the lack of a workflow that combines multiple-source information to facilitate the data interpretation. Results from different analytical techniques and literature reports need to be organized, processed, and interpreted to enable optimal decision-making for extracts prioritization. Here, we introduce Inventa, a computational tool that highlights the structural novelty potential within extracts, considering untargeted mass spectrometry data, spectral annotation, and literature reports. Based on this information, Inventa calculates multiple scores that inform their structural potential. Thus, Inventa has the potential to accelerate new natural products discovery. Inventa was applied to a set of plants from the Celastraceae family as a proof of concept. The Pristimera indica (Willd.) A.C.Sm roots extract was highlighted as a promising source of potentially novel compounds. Its phytochemical investigation resulted in the isolation and de novo characterization of thirteen new dihydro-β-agarofuran sesquiterpenes, five of them presenting a new 9-oxodihydro-β-agarofuran base scaffold.

ipaPy2	Annotation	Others		Summary: The Integrated Probabilistic Annotation (IPA) is an automated annotation method for LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics experiments that provides statistically rigorous estimates of the probabilities associated with each annotation. Here, we introduce ipaPy2, a substantially improved and completely refactored Python implementation of the IPA method. The revised method is now able to integrate tandem MS fragmentation data, which increases the accuracy of the identifications. Moreover, ipaPy2 provides a much more user-friendly interface, and isotope peaks are no longer treated as individual features but integrated into isotope fingerprints, greatly speeding up the calculations. The method has also been fully integrated with the mzMatch pipeline, so that the results of the annotation can be explored through the newly developed PeakMLViewerPy tool available at https://github.com/UoMMIB/PeakMLViewerPy.  Availability and implementation: The source code, extensive documentation, and tutorials are freely available on GitHub at https://github.com/francescodc87/ipaPy2. 	ipaPy2: Integrated Probabilistic Annotation (IPA) 2.0—an improved Bayesian-based method for the annotation of LC–MS/MS untargeted metabolomics data	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/39/7/btad455/7230779?login=true	Bioinformatics	Del Carratore, F., Eagles, W., Borka, J., & Breitling, R.

MCheM	Annotation	Others		Metabolite identification in non-targeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics remains a major challenge due to limited spectral library coverage and difficulties in predicting metabolite fragmentation patterns. Here, we introduce Multiplexed Chemical Metabolomics (MCheM), which employs orthogonal post-column derivatization reactions integrated into a unified mass spectrometry data framework. MCheM generates orthogonal structural information that substantially improves metabolite annotation through in silico spectrum matching and open-modification searches, offering a powerful new toolbox for the structure elucidation of unknown metabolites at scale. To improve annotation in non-targeted metabolomics studies, authors develop a Multiplexed Chemical Metabolomics (MCheM) platform, combining post-column derivatization with integrated data processing. MCheM enables feature-resolved chemical tagging across complex mixtures, which provides orthorgonal chemical information about unknown metabolites.

MetaboAnnotatoR	Annotation	Others		Untargeted metabolomics and lipidomics LC–MS experiments produce complex datasets, usually containing tens of thousands of features from thousands of metabolites whose annotation requires additional MS/MS experiments and expert knowledge. All-ion fragmentation (AIF) LC–MS/MS acquisition provides fragmentation data at no additional experimental time cost. However, analysis of such datasets requires reconstruction of parent–fragment relationships and annotation of the resulting pseudo-MS/MS spectra. Here, we propose a novel approach for automated annotation of isotopologues, adducts, and in-source fragments from AIF LC–MS datasets by combining correlation-based parent–fragment linking with molecular fragment matching. Our workflow focuses on a subset of features rather than trying to annotate the full dataset, saving time and simplifying the process. We demonstrate the workflow in three human serum datasets containing 599 features manually annotated by experts. Precision and recall values of 82–92% and 82–85%, respectively, were obtained for features found in the highest-rank scores (1–5). These results equal or outperform those obtained using MS-DIAL software, the current state of the art for AIF data annotation. Further validation for other biological matrices and different instrument types showed variable precision (60–89%) and recall (10–88%) particularly for datasets dominated by nonlipid metabolites. The workflow is freely available as an open-source R package, MetaboAnnotatoR, together with the fragment libraries from Github (https://github.com/gggraca/MetaboAnnotatoR).

MS2DECIDE	Annotation	Others		Mass spectrometry-based natural products (NPs) targeted discovery often relies on a complicated decision-making process involving tedious comparison of exact masses data and tandem mass spectra-based annotation tools output against various spectral reference libraries. To address this bottleneck, tandem mass spectrum to decision (MS2DECIDE) is presented which leverages decision theory and expert knowledge to aggregate the outputs of three widely used annotation tools (GNPS, Sirius, and ISDB-LOTUS) and computes a recommendation for targeting NPs with regard to their potential novelty. We demonstrate, through two case studies, that MS2DECIDE reliably captures the novelty of natural products from their tandem mass spectra. MS2DECIDE is freely accessible on GitHub.

mWISE	Annotation	Others		Untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS) allows the detection of thousands of metabolites in biological samples. However, LC–MS data annotation is still considered a major bottleneck in the metabolomics pipeline since only a small fraction of the metabolites present in the sample can be annotated with the required confidence level. Here, we introduce mWISE (metabolomics wise inference of speck entities), an R package for context-based annotation of LC–MS data. The algorithm consists of three main steps aimed at (i) matching mass-to-charge ratio values to the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database, (ii) clustering and filtering the potential KEGG candidates, and (iii) building a final prioritized list using diffusion in graphs. The algorithm performance is evaluated with three publicly available studies using both positive and negative ionization modes. We have also compared mWISE to other available annotation algorithms in terms of their performance and computation time. In particular, we explored four different configurations for mWISE, and all four of them outperform xMSannotator (a state-of-the-art annotator) in terms of both performance and computation time. Using a diffusion configuration that combines the biological network obtained from the FELLA R package and raw scores, mWISE shows a sensitivity mean (standard deviation) across data sets of 0.63 (0.07), while xMSannotator achieves a sensitivity of 0.55 (0.19). We have also shown that the chemical structures of the compounds proposed by mWISE are closer to the original compounds than those proposed by xMSannotator. Finally, we explore the diffusion prioritization separately, showing its key role in the annotation process. mWISE is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/b2slab/mWISE) under a GPL license.	mWISE: An Algorithm for Context-Based Annotation of Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry Features through Diffusion in Graphs	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c00238	Analytical Chemistry	Barranco-Altirriba, M., Solà-Santos, P., Picart-Armada, S., Kanaan-Izquierdo, S., Fonollosa, J., & Perera-Lluna, A.

NetID	Annotation	Others		Liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics aims to identify and quantify all metabolites, but most LC-MS peaks remain unidentified. Here we present a global network optimization approach, NetID, to annotate untargeted LC-MS metabolomics data. The approach aims to generate, for all experimentally observed ion peaks, annotations that match the measured masses, retention times and (when available) tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns. Peaks are connected based on mass differences reflecting adduction, fragmentation, isotopes, or feasible biochemical transformations. Global optimization generates a single network linking most observed ion peaks, enhances peak assignment accuracy, and produces chemically informative peak–peak relationships, including for peaks lacking tandem mass spectrometry spectra. Applying this approach to yeast and mouse data, we identified five previously unrecognized metabolites (thiamine derivatives and N-glucosyl-taurine). Isotope tracer studies indicate active flux through these metabolites. Thus, NetID applies existing metabolomic knowledge and global optimization to substantially improve annotation coverage and accuracy in untargeted metabolomics datasets, facilitating metabolite discovery.

OrbiFragsNets	Annotation	Others		We introduce OrbiFragsNets, a tool for automatic annotation of MS2 spectra generated by Orbitrap instruments, as well as the concepts of chemical consistency and fragments networks. OrbiFragsNets takes advantage of the specific confidence interval for each peak in every MS2 spectrum, which is an unclear idea across the high-resolution mass spectrometry literature. The spectrum annotations are expressed as fragments networks, a set of networks with the possible combinations of annotations for the fragments. The model behind OrbiFragsNets is briefly described here and explained in detail in the constantly updated manual available in the GitHub repository. This new approach in MS2 spectrum de novo automatic annotation proved to perform as good as well established tools such as RMassBank and SIRIUS.	OrbiFragsNets.

BLINK	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Metabolomics has a long history of using cosine similarity to match experimental tandem mass spectra to databases for compound identification. Here we introduce the Blur-and-Link (BLINK) approach for scoring cosine similarity. By bypassing fragment alignment and simultaneously scoring all pairs of spectra using sparse matrix operations, BLINK is over 3000 times faster than MatchMS, a widely used loop-based alignment and scoring implementation. Using a similarity cutoff of 0.7, BLINK and MatchMS had practically equivalent identification agreement, and greater than 99% of their scores and matching ion counts were identical. This performance improvement can enable calculations to be performed that would typically be limited by time and available computational resources.

falcon	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Rationale Advanced algorithmic solutions are necessary to process the ever-increasing amounts of mass spectrometry data that are being generated. In this study, we describe the falcon spectrum clustering tool for efficient clustering of millions of MS/MS spectra. Methods falcon succeeds in efficiently clustering large amounts of mass spectral data using advanced techniques for fast spectrum similarity searching. First, high-resolution spectra are binned and converted to low-dimensional vectors using feature hashing. Next, the spectrum vectors are used to construct nearest neighbor indexes for fast similarity searching. The nearest neighbor indexes are used to efficiently compute a sparse pairwise distance matrix without having to exhaustively perform all pairwise spectrum comparisons within the relevant precursor mass tolerance. Finally, density-based clustering is performed to group similar spectra into clusters. Results Several state-of-the-art spectrum clustering tools were evaluated using a large draft human proteome data set consisting of 25 million spectra, indicating that alternative tools produce clustering results with different characteristics. Notably, falcon generates larger highly pure clusters than alternative tools, leading to a larger reduction in data volume without the loss of relevant information for more efficient downstream processing. Conclusions  falcon is a highly efficient spectrum clustering tool, which is publicly available as an open source under the permissive BSD license at https://github.com/bittremieux/falcon.

FastEI	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Spectrum matching is the most common method for compound identification in mass spectrometry (MS). However, some challenges limit its efficiency, including the coverage of spectral libraries, the accuracy, and the speed of matching. In this study, a million-scale in-silico EI-MS library is established. Furthermore, an ultra-fast and accurate spectrum matching (FastEI) method is proposed to substantially improve accuracy using Word2vec spectral embedding and boost the speed using the hierarchical navigable small-world graph (HNSW). It achieves 80.4% recall@10 accuracy (88.3% with 5 Da mass filter) with a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared with the weighted cosine similarity method (WCS). When FastEI is applied to identify the molecules beyond NIST 2017 library, it achieves 50% recall@1 accuracy. FastEI is packaged as a standalone and user-friendly software for common users with limited computational backgrounds. Overall, FastEI combined with a million-scale in-silico library facilitates compound identification as an accurate and ultra-fast tool.

Flash entropy search	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Public repositories of metabolomics mass spectra encompass more than 1 billion entries. With open search, dot product or entropy similarity, comparisons of a single tandem mass spectrometry spectrum take more than 8 h. Flash entropy search speeds up calculations more than 10,000 times to query 1 billion spectra in less than 2 s, without loss in accuracy. It benefits from using multiple threads and GPU calculations. This algorithm can fully exploit large spectral libraries with little memory overhead for any mass spectrometry laboratory.

MASST+	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		The throughput of mass spectrometers and the amount of publicly available metabolomics data are growing rapidly, but analysis tools such as molecular networking and Mass Spectrometry Search Tool do not scale to searching and clustering billions of mass spectral data in metabolomics repositories. To address this limitation, we designed MASST+ and Networking+, which can process datasets that are up to three orders of magnitude larger than those processed by state-of-the-art tools. MASST+ speeds up querying of metabolomics mass spectrometry data by two orders of magnitude.

metID	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Accurate and efficient compound annotation is a long-standing challenge for LC–MS-based data (e.g. untargeted metabolomics and exposomics). Substantial efforts have been devoted to overcoming this obstacle, whereas current tools are limited by the sources of spectral information used (in-house and public databases) and are not automated and streamlined. Therefore, we developed metID, an R package that combines information from all major databases for comprehensive and streamlined compound annotation. metID is a flexible, simple and powerful tool that can be installed on all platforms, allowing the compound annotation process to be fully automatic and reproducible. A detailed tutorial and a case study are provided in Supplementary Materials.	metID: an R package for automatable compound annotation for LC−MS-based data 	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btab583/6357695	Bioinformatics	Shen, X., Wu, S., Liang, L., Chen, S., Contrepois, K., Zhu, Z.

mineMS2 	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Abstract Identification is a major challenge in metabolomics due to the large structural diversity of metabolites. Tandem mass spectrometry is a reference technology for studying the fragmentation of molecules and characterizing their structure. Recent instruments can fragment large amounts of compounds in a single acquisition. The search for similarities within a collection of MS/MS spectra is a powerful approach to facilitate the identification of new metabolites. We propose an innovative de novo strategy for searching for exact fragmentation patterns within collections of MS/MS spectra. This approach is based on (i) a new representation of spectra as graphs of m/z differences, and (ii) an efficient frequent-subgraph mining algorithm. We demonstrate both on a spectral database from standards and on acquisitions in biological matrices that these new fragmentation patterns capture similarities that are not extracted by existing methods, and facilitate the structural interpretation of molecular network components and the elucidation of unknown spectra. The mineMS2 software is publicly available as an R package (https://github.com/odisce/mineMS2)      Scientific contribution   We present an innovative strategy for structural elucidation, which extracts exact fragmentation patterns of m/z differences within collections of MS/MS spectra. The algorithms are implemented in a software library enabling efficient mining of MS/MS data and coupling to molecular networks. We show on real datasets the specific value of the patterns as fragmentation graphs for structural interpretation and de novo identification, and their complementarity to existing approaches.	mineMS2: annotation of spectral libraries with exact fragmentation patterns	https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-025-01051-y	Journal of Cheminformatics	Delabrière, Alexis, Gianfrotta, Coline, Dechaumet, Sylvain, Damont, Annelaure, Hautbergue, Thaïs, Roger, Pierrick, Jamin, Emilien L., Puel, Olivier, Junot, Christophe, Fenaille, François, & Thévenot, Etienne A.

MolDiscovery	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Identification of small molecules is a critical task in various areas of life science. Recent advances in mass spectrometry have enabled the collection of tandem mass spectra of small molecules from hundreds of thousands of environments. To identify which molecules are present in a sample, one can search mass spectra collected from the sample against millions of molecular structures in small molecule databases. The existing approaches are based on chemistry domain knowledge, and they fail to explain many of the peaks in mass spectra of small molecules. Here, we present molDiscovery, a mass spectral database search method that improves both efficiency and accuracy of small molecule identification by learning a probabilistic model to match small molecules with their mass spectra. A search of over 8 million spectra from the Global Natural Product Social molecular networking infrastructure shows that molDiscovery correctly identify six times more unique small molecules than previous methods.

MS/MS spectral entropy similarity	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Compound identification in small-molecule research, such as untargeted metabolomics or exposome research, relies on matching tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra against experimental or in silico mass spectral libraries. Most software programs use dot product similarity scores. Here we introduce the concept of MS/MS spectral entropy to improve scoring results in MS/MS similarity searches via library matching. Entropy similarity outperformed 42 alternative similarity algorithms, including dot product similarity, when searching 434,287 spectra against the high-quality NIST20 library. Entropy similarity scores proved to be highly robust even when we added different levels of noise ions. When we applied entropy levels to 37,299 experimental spectra of natural products, false discovery rates of less than 10% were observed at entropy similarity score 0.75. Experimental human gut metabolome data were used to confirm that entropy similarity largely improved the accuracy of MS-based annotations in small-molecule research to false discovery rates below 10%, annotated new compounds and provided the basis to automatically flag poor-quality, noisy spectra.

NA	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		MS² spectral similarity is fundamental to interpreting LC-HRMS-NTA data. Beyond the commonly used cosine similarity, a wide range of alternative metrics, including distance-, probability-, and machine-learning–based approaches, provide different perspectives on spectral matching. In this study, we extracted 8,290 subdatasets from publicly available LC-HRMS/MS libraries (MassBank, MoNa, GNPS, and NIST), each containing spectra sharing a precursor m/z within a 5 mDa tolerance. We evaluated 20 similarity metrics by constructing single-generation local molecular networks. Most metrics failed to produce pure networks, achieving complete resolution in only ~8\% of cases at the recommended 0.7 threshold and ~20\% even when individually optimized. The number of fragment ions showed little influence on network resolution. Instead, performance was driven primarily by the similarity metric and thresholding behavior, indicating that library matching alone rarely supports identification confidence above level 3. These findings highlight the need for cumulative strategies that integrate multiple similarity perspectives and orthogonal information, such as retention time or index.

Reverse Spectral Search	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		The exponential growth of untargeted metabolomics data, now reaching billions of mass spectra in public repositories, benefits from reannotation strategies for data reuse. While tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) library matching remains the gold standard, annotation workflows face a critical bottleneck: chimeric spectra. These composite spectra, arising from simultaneous fragmentation of multiple precursor ions, compromise the ability to annotate MS/MS spectra against nonchimeric reference spectra. Here, we demonstrate that an enhanced version of reverse spectral search, a principle first introduced in 1975 but largely overlooked, provides a simple, computationally efficient solution, rescuing up to 62% more metabolite annotations in benchmark data sets while maintaining stringent quality control. The enhanced reverse spectral search is now added to the GNPS ecosystem. Source codes can be accessed at https://github.com/Philipbear/reverse_search.

SimMS	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Motivation Untargeted metabolomics involves a large-scale comparison of the fragmentation pattern of a mass spectrum against a database containing known spectra. Given the number of comparisons involved, this step can be time-consuming. Results In this work, we present a GPU-accelerated cosine similarity implementation for Tandem Mass Spectrometry (MS), with an approximately 1000-fold speedup compared to the MatchMS reference implementation, without any loss of accuracy. This improvement enables repository-scale spectral library matching for compound identification without the need for large compute clusters. This impact extends to any spectral comparison-based methods such as molecular networking approaches and analogue search.

Weighted spectral similarity for library search	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval		Calculating spectral similarity is a fundamental step in MS/MS data analysis in untargeted metabolomics experiments, as it facilitates the identification of related spectra and the annotation of compounds. To improve matching accuracy when querying an experimental mass spectrum against a spectral library, previous approaches have proposed increasing peak intensities for high m/z ranges. These high m/z values tend to be smaller in magnitude, yet they offer more crucial information for identifying the chemical structure. Here, we evaluate the impact of using these weights for identifying structurally related compounds and mass spectral library searches. Additionally, we propose a weighting approach that (i) takes into account the frequency of the m/z values within a spectral library in order to assign higher importance to the most common peaks and (ii) increases the intensity of lower peaks, similar to previous approaches. To demonstrate our approach, we applied weighting preprocessing to modified cosine, entropy, and fidelity distance metrics and benchmarked it against previously reported weights. Our results demonstrate how weighting-based preprocessing can assist in annotating the structure of unknown spectra as well as identifying structurally similar compounds. Finally, we examined scenarios in which the utilization of weights resulted in diminished performance, pinpointing spectral features where the application of weights might be detrimental.

ENTAiLS Toolkit	Annotation	Workflow tools		Environmental health concerns over per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) have prompted public health laboratories to pursue monitoring studies determining PFAS occurrences. Select laboratories have begun implementing non-targeted analysis (NTA) methods to address the disparity between the few (< 100) PFAS typically measured using targeted analyses and the thousands of known PFAS. While NTA can provide a more comprehensive understanding of PFAS occurrence, significant barriers prevent its widespread adoption in public health laboratories. Notable barriers include a lack of harmonized guidance, standardized methods, and workflows that enable robust NTA application. EPA’s Office of Research and Development has been working to overcome these barriers as part of technical collaborations with state environmental and public health laboratories. As a product of these efforts, ORD has developed the ENTAiLS Toolkit, a publicly available compilation of best practices and an open-source data processing workflow for PFAS NTA studies. The ENTAiLS Toolkit offers NTA practitioners comprehensive guidance and integrated tools that can aid the identification and characterization of PFAS in drinking water resources.

MetaboCoreUtils, MetaboAnnotation and CompoundDb	Annotation	Workflow tools		Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based untargeted metabolomics experiments have become increasingly popular because of the wide range of metabolites that can be analyzed and the possibility to measure novel compounds. LC-MS instrumentation and analysis conditions can differ substantially among laboratories and experiments, thus resulting in non-standardized datasets demanding customized annotation workflows. We present an ecosystem of R packages, centered around the MetaboCoreUtils, MetaboAnnotation and CompoundDb packages that together provide a modular infrastructure for the annotation of untargeted metabolomics data. Initial annotation can be performed based on MS1 properties such as m/z and retention times, followed by an MS2-based annotation in which experimental fragment spectra are compared against a reference library. Such reference databases can be created and managed with the CompoundDb package. The ecosystem supports data from a variety of formats, including, but not limited to, MSP, MGF, mzML, mzXML, netCDF as well as MassBank text files and SQL databases. Through its highly customizable functionality, the presented infrastructure allows to build reproducible annotation workflows tailored for and adapted to most untargeted LC-MS-based datasets. All core functionality, which supports base R data types, is exported, also facilitating its re-use in other R packages. Finally, all packages are thoroughly unit-tested and documented and are available on GitHub and through Bioconductor.

MetaFetcheR	Annotation	Workflow tools		Motivation Small-compound databases contain large amount of information for metabolites and metabolic pathways. However, the plethora of such databases and the redundancy of their information lead to major issues with analysis and standardization. Lack of preventive establishment of means of data access at the infant stages of a project might lead to mislabelled compounds, reduced statistical power and large delays in delivery of results.    ResultsWe developed MetaFetcheR, an open-source R package that links metabolite data from several small-compound databases, resolves inconsistencies and covers a variety of use-cases of data fetching. We showed that the performance of MetaFetcheR was superior to existing approaches and databases by benchmarking the performance of the algorithm in two independent case studies based on two published datasets.

MS2Query	Annotation	Workflow tools	Yes	Metabolomics-driven discoveries of biological samples remain hampered by the grand challenge of metabolite annotation and identification. Only few metabolites have an annotated spectrum in spectral libraries; hence, searching only for exact library matches generally returns a few hits. An attractive alternative is searching for so-called analogues as a starting point for structural annotations; analogues are library molecules which are not exact matches but display a high chemical similarity. However, current analogue search implementations are not yet very reliable and relatively slow. Here, we present MS2Query, a machine learning-based tool that integrates mass spectral embedding-based chemical similarity predictors (Spec2Vec and MS2Deepscore) as well as detected precursor masses to rank potential analogues and exact matches. Benchmarking MS2Query on reference mass spectra and experimental case studies demonstrate improved reliability and scalability. Thereby, MS2Query offers exciting opportunities to further increase the annotation rate of metabolomics profiles of complex metabolite mixtures and to discover new biology.

mscompiler	Annotation	Workflow tools		Chemical contamination is one of the major obstacles for mechanical recycling of plastics. In this article, we built and open-sourced an in-house MS/MS library containing more than 500 plastic-related chemicals and developed mspcompiler, an R package, for the compilation of various libraries. We then proposed a workflow to process untargeted screening data acquired by liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometry. These tools were subsequently employed to data originating from recycled high-density polyethylene (rHDPE) obtained from milk bottles. A total of 83 compounds were identified, with 66 easily annotated by making use of our in-house MS/MS libraries and the mspcompiler R package. In silico fragmentation combined with data obtained from gas chromatography–mass spectrometry and lists of chemicals related to plastics were used to identify those remaining unknown. A pseudo-multiple reaction monitoring method was also applied to sensitively target and screen the identified chemicals in the samples. Quantification results demonstrated that a good sorting of postconsumer materials and a better recycling technology may be necessary for food contact applications. Removal or reduction of non-volatile substances, such as octocrylene and 2-ethylhexyl-4-methoxycinnamate, is still challenging but vital for the safe use of rHDPE as food contact materials.

mspepsearchr	Annotation	Workflow tools		High-level programming languages such as Python and R are widely used in mass spectrometry data processing, where library searching is a standard step. Despite the availability of numerous library search algorithms, those developed by NIST and implemented in MS Search remain predominant, partly because commercial databases (e.g., NIST, Wiley) are distributed in proprietary formats inaccessible to custom code. MSPepSearch, another NIST tool, provides access to the same algorithms with greater flexibility for automation. However, its use requires calling a command-line interface with multiple flags and parsing output text files to retrieve results, which can be cumbersome. To address this, we developed mspepsearchr, an R package that streamlines the integration of library searches against NIST-format mass spectral databases into complex, multistep workflows. MSPepSearch is a single-threaded tool; therefore, parallelization was achieved externally by running multiple instances from within R.

PS2MS	Annotation	Workflow tools	Yes	The rapid proliferation of new psychoactive substances (NPS) poses significant challenges to conventional mass-spectrometry-based identification methods due to the absence of reference spectra for these emerging substances. This paper introduces PS2MS, an AI-powered predictive system designed specifically to address the limitations of identifying the emergence of unidentified novel illicit drugs. PS2MS builds a synthetic NPS database by enumerating feasible derivatives of known substances and uses deep learning to generate mass spectra and chemical fingerprints. When the mass spectrum of an analyte does not match any known reference, PS2MS simultaneously examines the chemical fingerprint and mass spectrum against the putative NPS database using integrated metrics to deduce possible identities. Experimental results affirm the effectiveness of PS2MS in identifying cathinone derivatives within real evidence specimens, signifying its potential for practical use in identifying emerging drugs of abuse for researchers and forensic experts.

RapidMass	Annotation	Workflow tools		High-throughput mass spectrometry (HT-MS) facilitates rapid, large-scale data acquisition, providing a fast and efficient solution for various analytical challenges. However, the increasing volume of data generated by MS requires automation and easy-to-use processing tools. Currently, there is no freely available software that is compatible with most instruments for species authentication or classification. Here, we introduce RapidMass, a cutting-edge software platform designed to automate the handling, evaluation, presentation, and management of HT-MS data for species identification. Key features include a streamlined workflow for processing spectra from various instruments (e.g., DI-MS, ASAP-MS, DART-MS), three specialized algorithms for scoring unknown samples, peak annotation review, visualization of MS1 and MS2 spectra, and an expandable personal database for customized data management. Performance validation conducted on nine data sets covering diverse sample compositions, instrument types, suppliers, resolutions, and MS acquisition modes, demonstrated RapidMass’s excellent performance, with processing times of 12 to 20 s per sample and authentication accuracies ranging from 97% to 100% for easily confused plants. With its user-friendly interface, RapidMass empowers users to create and manage personalized databases, presenting significant prospects for broad applications across various fields.

Scannotation	Annotation	Workflow tools		In an increasingly chemically polluted environment, rapidly characterizing the human chemical exposome (i.e., chemical mixtures accumulating in humans) at the population scale is critical to understand its impact on health. High-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) profiling of complex biological matrices can theoretically provide a comprehensive picture of chemical exposures. However, annotating the detected chemical features, particularly low-abundant ones, remains a significant obstacle to implementing such approaches at a large scale. We present Scannotation (https://github.com/scannotation/Scannotation_software), an automated and user-friendly suspect screening tool for the rapid pre-annotation of HRMS preprocessed data sets. This software tool combines several MS1 chemical predictors, i.e., m/z, experimental and predicted retention times, isotopic patterns, and neutral loss patterns, to score the proximity between features and suspects, thus efficiently prioritizing tentative annotations to verify. Scannotation and MS-DIAL4 were used to annotate blood serum samples of 75 Breton adolescents. Scannotation’s combination of MS1-based chemical predictors allowed us to annotate 89 chemically diverse environmental compounds with high confidence (confirmed by MS2 when available). These compounds included 62% of emerging molecules, for which no toxicological or human biomonitoring data are reported in the literature. The complementarity observed with MS-DIAL4 results demonstrates the relevance of Scannotation for the efficient pre-annotation of large-scale exposomics data sets.

SiMD	Annotation	Workflow tools		This study presents the development and validation of a liquid chromatography–quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry method with data-independent acquisition (LC-QTOF-MSE) for targeted quantification, post-targeted screening, and untargeted metabolite profiling. Using MS1-based precursor ion quantification, the method demonstrated excellent analytical performance with linearity (R² > 0.99), accuracy (84 %–131 %), and precision (1 %–17 % relative standard deviation (RSD)). Although LC-QTOF‑MSE sensitivity is at least nine-fold lower than LC-triple quadrupole MS with multiple reaction monitoring, it remains adequate for quantifying urinary metabolites, particularly those that fragment poorly or yield low‑intensity product ions. For post‑targeted screening and untargeted profiling, an in‑house reference library (the Siriraj Metabolomics Data Warehouse, SiMD), comprising 174 curated metabolite standards, was integrated into the workflow to enhance metabolite identification confidence. The official website for SiMD can be accessed at https://si-simd.com/. To demonstrate the method’s utility, 11 amino and organic acids were quantified in urine samples from 100 healthy individuals. Four compounds—L-methionine, L-histidine, L-tryptophan, and trans-ferulic acid—were significantly higher levels in females (P < 0.05), likely reflecting sex-specific physiological or dietary intake differences. Post‑targeted screening identified 29 additional metabolites and assigned them to level 1 (m/z, RT, isotope pattern, and MS/MS spectra matched to reference standards) based on the Metabolomics Standards Initiative guidelines. Untargeted retrospective profiling revealed level 1 seven metabolites, including ribitol, creatine, glucuronic acid, trans-ferulic acid, succinic acid, dimethylglycine, and 3-hydroxyphenylacetic acid related to sex variation (VIP > 1.5). In summary, the LC-QTOF-MSE method coupled with SiMD provides a robust and comprehensive workflow for metabolomics analysis. It enables reliable target quantification and enhances confidence in metabolite identification while also reducing sample and instrumental demands. These features make it particularly well-suited for clinical metabolomics studies.

CANOPUS	Annotation	Class | Property prediction	Yes	Metabolomics using nontargeted tandem mass spectrometry can detect thousands of molecules in a biological sample. However, structural molecule annotation is limited to structures present in libraries or databases, restricting analysis and interpretation of experimental data. Here we describe CANOPUS (class assignment and ontology prediction using mass spectrometry), a computational tool for systematic compound class annotation. CANOPUS uses a deep neural network to predict 2,497 compound classes from fragmentation spectra, including all biologically relevant classes. CANOPUS explicitly targets compounds for which neither spectral nor structural reference data are available and predicts classes lacking tandem mass spectrometry training data. In evaluation using reference data, CANOPUS reached very high prediction performance (average accuracy of 99.7% in cross-validation) and outperformed four baseline methods. We demonstrate the broad utility of CANOPUS by investigating the effect of microbial colonization in the mouse digestive system, through analysis of the chemodiversity of different Euphorbia plants and regarding the discovery of a marine natural product, revealing biological insights at the compound class level.

Mass Spectrum Transformer 	Annotation	Class | Property prediction	Yes	Molecular properties prediction is an important task in the field of materials, especially in computational drug and materials discovery. Deep learning (DL) is one of the most popular methods for molecular properties prediction due to its ability to establish quantitative relationships between molecular representations and target properties. In order to improve the performance of DL algorithms, it is crucial to select appropriate representation of molecules. Molecular graph has become one of the choices as it can be easily input into graph neural network (GNN)-based DL models for learning. However, model performance is limited if molecular representation is only used because it only contains atomic information, bond information, and adjacency relationships between atoms. Therefore, we use molecular mass spectrum as another representation to provide supplement information which is not contained in the graph data. In this paper, a transformer-based model, named Mass Spectrum Transformer (MST), is proposed to perform quantitative analysis of molecular spectra, then it is combined with the graph neural network to form a multi-modal data fusion model TransG-Net for accurate molecular properties prediction. Several feature fusion methods are adopted and the best method is chosen to further enhance the performance of the model. A multi-modal dataset is collected in this paper which is composed of molecular graph data and spectra. Data augmentation is performed to simulate the experimentally measured molecular spectra for the generalizability of the model. Experimental results show that MST outperforms previous best mass spectrum-based methods for molecular properties prediction. In addition, TransG-Net combining MST and GNN achieves better performance than state-of-the-art well-designed message passing models, which proves the effectiveness of our multi-modal data fusion method.

MS2Prop	Annotation	Class | Property prediction	Yes	Mass spectrometry (MS) is a fundamental analytical tool for the study of complex molecular mixtures and in natural products drug discovery and metabolomics specifically, due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. A major challenge, however, is the lack of structurally annotated mass spectra for these applications. This deficiency is particularly acute for analyses conducted on extracts or fractions that are largely chemically undefined. This work describes the use of mass spectral data in a fundamentally different manner than structure determination; to predict properties or activities of structurally unknown compounds without the need for defined or deduced chemical structure using a machine learning (ML) model, MS2Prop. The model’s predictive accuracy and scalability is benchmarked against commonly used methods and its performance demonstrated in a natural products drug discovery setting. A new cheminformatic subdiscipline, quantitative spectra-activity relationships (QSpAR), using spectra rather than chemical structure as input, is proposed to describe this approach and to distinguish it from structure based quantitative methods.

MWFormer	Annotation	Class | Property prediction	Yes	Molecular weight (MW) is a crucial property to improve the accuracy of multidimensional compound identification. In this study, we have developed MWFormer, a novel method that predicts MWs solely from spectra of electron ionization mass spectrometry (EI-MS) based on a Transformer encoder. MWFormer achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 6.38 Da, which is only one-sixth of the MAE by the peak interpretation method (PIM) on the test set. The MWFormer-predicted MW with superior accuracy can be used to eliminate false positive molecules in multidimensional compound identification. The results show that the MW filter improves the recall@3 metric by nearly 4% points compared with solely spectrum matching results. Moreover, MWFormer can be combined with retention indices (RIs) to achieve GC-EI-MS 3D compound identification to improve the recall@3 metric by nearly 7% points, compared with the results of spectrum matching alone. Besides, a user-friendly web service is provided to predict MWs in single mode or batch mode. All code, data, and models are available at https://github.com/zhanghailiangcsu/MWFormer.

Spec2Class	Annotation	Class | Property prediction	Yes	Mass spectrometry (MS)-based data is commonly used in studying metabolism and natural products, but typically requires domain-specific skill and experience to analyze. Existing computational tools for non-targeted metabolite analysis (i.e., metabolomics) mostly rely on comparison to reference MS spectral libraries for metabolite identification, limiting the annotation of metabolites for which reference spectra do not exist. This is the case in plant secondary metabolites, where most spectral features remain unidentified. Here, we developed Spec2Class, a deep-learning algorithm for the identification and classification of plant secondary metabolites from liquid chromatography (LC)-MS/MS spectra. We used the in-house spectral library of 7973 plant metabolite chemical standards, alongside publicly available data, to train Spec2Class to classify LC-MS/MS spectra to 43 common plant secondary metabolite classes. Tested on held out sets, our algorithm achieved an overall accuracy of 73%, outperforming state-of-the-art classification. We further established a prediction certainty parameter to set a threshold for low-confidence results. Applying this threshold, we reached an accuracy of 93% on an unseen dataset. We show a high robustness of our prediction to noise and to the data acquisition method. Spec2Class is publicly available and is anticipated to facilitate metabolite identification and accelerate natural product discovery. Significance Statement Untargeted mass spectrometry (MS) is essential for natural product discovery but is limited by product identification, which is often manual and requires domain-specific skills. Spec2Class addresses this limitation by accurately classifying plant secondary metabolites from LC-MS/MS spectra without reliance on reference spectral libraries. Trained on a substantial dataset and using a prediction certainty threshold, it outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms with 93% accuracy. This tool demonstrates high robustness against noise and different data acquisition methods, promising to streamline metabolite identification and expedite natural product research. Spec2Class is open-source, publicly available, and easy to integrate into natural product discovery pipelines.

DiffMS	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Mass spectrometry plays a fundamental role in elucidating the structures of unknown molecules and subsequent scientific discoveries. One formulation of the structure elucidation task is the conditional de novo generation of molecular structure given a mass spectrum. Toward a more accurate and efficient scientific discovery pipeline for small molecules, we present DiffMS, a formula-restricted encoder-decoder generative network that achieves state-of-the-art performance on this task. The encoder utilizes a transformer architecture and models mass spectra domain knowledge such as peak formulae and neutral losses, and the decoder is a discrete graph diffusion model restricted by the heavy-atom composition of a known chemical formula. To develop a robust decoder that bridges latent embeddings and molecular structures, we pretrain the diffusion decoder with fingerprint-structure pairs, which are available in virtually infinite quantities, compared to structure-spectrum pairs that number in the tens of thousands. Extensive experiments on established benchmarks show that DiffMS outperforms existing models on de novo molecule generation. We provide several ablations to demonstrate the effectiveness of our diffusion and pretraining approaches and show consistent performance scaling with increasing pretraining dataset size. DiffMS code is publicly available at this https URL.

Mass2SMILES	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Modern mass spectrometry-based metabolomics generates vast amounts of mass spectral data as part of the chemical inventory of biospecimens. Annotation of the resulting MS/MS spectra remains a challenging task that mostly relies on database interrogations, in silico prediction and interpretation of diagnostic fragmentation schemes and/or expert knowledge-based manual interpretations. A key limitation is additionally that these approaches typically leave a vast proportion of the (bio)chemical space unannotated. Here we report a deep neural network method to predict chemical structures solely from high-resolution MS/MS spectra. This novel approach initially relies on the encoding of SMILES strings from chemical structures using a continuous chemical descriptor space that had been previously implemented for molecule design. The deep neural network was trained on 83,358 natural product-derived MS/MS spectra of the GNPS library and of the NIST HRMS database with addition of the calculated neutral losses for those spectra. After this training and parameter optimization phase, the deep neural network approach was then used to predict structures from MS/MS spectra not included in the training data-set. Our current version, implemented in the Python programming language, accurately predicted 7 structures from 744 validation structures and the following 14 structures had a Tanimoto similarity score above 0.9 when compared to the true structure. It was also able to correctly identify two structures from the CASMI 2022 international contest. On average the Tanimoto similarity is of 0.40 for data of the CASMI 2022 international contest and of 0.39 for the validation data-set. Finally, our deep neural network is also able to predict the number of 60 functional groups as well as the molecular formula of chemical structures and adduct type for the analyzed MS/MS spectra. Importantly, this deep neural network approach is extremely fast, in comparison to currently available methods, making it suitable to predict on regular computers structures for all substances within large metabolomics datasets.

MassGenie	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	The ‘inverse problem’ of mass spectrometric molecular identification (‘given a mass spectrum, calculate/predict the 2D structure of the molecule whence it came’) is largely unsolved, and is especially acute in metabolomics where many small molecules remain unidentified. This is largely because the number of experimentally available electrospray mass spectra of small molecules is quite limited. However, the forward problem (‘calculate a small molecule’s likely fragmentation and hence at least some of its mass spectrum from its structure alone’) is much more tractable, because the strengths of different chemical bonds are roughly known. This kind of molecular identification problem may be cast as a language translation problem in which the source language is a list of high-resolution mass spectral peaks and the ‘translation’ a representation (for instance in SMILES) of the molecule. It is thus suitable for attack using the deep neural networks known as transformers. We here present MassGenie, a method that uses a transformer-based deep neural network, trained on ~6 million chemical structures with augmented SMILES encoding and their paired molecular fragments as generated in silico, explicitly including the protonated molecular ion. This architecture (containing some 400 million elements) is used to predict the structure of a molecule from the various fragments that may be expected to be observed when some of its bonds are broken. Despite being given essentially no detailed nor explicit rules about molecular fragmentation methods, isotope patterns, rearrangements, neutral losses, and the like, MassGenie learns the effective properties of the mass spectral fragment and valency space, and can generate candidate molecular structures that are very close or identical to those of the ‘true’ molecules. We also use VAE-Sim, a previously published variational autoencoder, to generate candidate molecules that are ‘similar’ to the top hit. In addition to using the ‘top hits’ directly, we can produce a rank order of these by ‘round-tripping’ candidate molecules and comparing them with the true molecules, where known. As a proof of principle, we confine ourselves to positive electrospray mass spectra from molecules with a molecular mass of 500Da or lower, including those in the last CASMI challenge (for which the results are known), getting 49/93 (53%) precisely correct. The transformer method, applied here for the first time to mass spectral interpretation, works extremely effectively both for mass spectra generated in silico and on experimentally obtained mass spectra from pure compounds. It seems to act as a Las Vegas algorithm, in that it either gives the correct answer or simply states that it cannot find one. The ability to create and to ‘learn’ millions of fragmentation patterns in silico, and therefrom generate candidate structures (that do not have to be in existing libraries) directly, thus opens up entirely the field of de novo small molecule structure prediction from experimental mass spectra.

MASSISTANT	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Gas chromatography coupled with electron impact mass spectrometry (GC‑EI‑MS) is a widely used analytical technique for identifying volatile and semi‑volatile compounds in applications ranging from pharmaceutical research to material science. However, since not every molecule is included in EI‑MS databases, scientists often have to identify unknown chromatographic peaks solely from their EI‑MS spectra. This manual interpretation is time-consuming and depends heavily on expert knowledge, often leading to ambiguous or inconclusive results. In this work, we introduce MASSISTANT, a novel deep learning model that directly predicts de novo molecular structures from low‑resolution EI‑MS spectra using SELFIES encoding. Trained on compounds with molecular weights below 600 Da, MASSISTANT’s performance is sensitive to dataset curation; while training on the full NIST dataset (180k spectra) yields approximately 10% exact predictions, a more focused, chemically homogeneous subset boosts this rate to as high as 54% (Tanimoto score = 1). These results highlight the capability of deep neural networks to capture complex fragmentation patterns and generate chemically valid structures, offering mass spectrometry scientists a powerful tool to enhance the interpretation and elucidation of whole molecular structures but also substructures, and functional groups in GC‑EI‑MS analyses.

MS-BART	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Mass spectrometry (MS) plays a critical role in molecular identification, significantly advancing scientific discovery. However, structure elucidation from MS data remains challenging due to the scarcity of annotated spectra. While large-scale pretraining has proven effective in addressing data scarcity in other domains, applying this paradigm to mass spectrometry is hindered by the complexity and heterogeneity of raw spectral signals. To address this, we propose MS-BART, a unified modeling framework that maps mass spectra and molecular structures into a shared token vocabulary, enabling cross-modal learning through large-scale pretraining on reliably computed fingerprint-molecule datasets. Multi-task pretraining objectives further enhance MS-BART's generalization by jointly optimizing denoising and translation task. The pretrained model is subsequently transferred to experimental spectra through finetuning on fingerprint predictions generated with MIST, a pre-trained spectral inference model, thereby enhancing robustness to real-world spectral variability. While finetuning alleviates the distributional difference, MS-BART still suffers molecular hallucination and requires further alignment. We therefore introduce a chemical feedback mechanism that guides the model toward generating molecules closer to the reference structure. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MS-BART achieves SOTA performance across 5/12 key metrics on MassSpecGym and NPLIB1 and is faster by one order of magnitude than competing diffusion-based methods, while comprehensive ablation studies systematically validate the model's effectiveness and robustness.

MS2Mol	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	The ability to identify small molecules in complex samples from their mass spectra is among the grand challenges of analytical chemistry. Improvements to this ability could significantly advance fields as diverse as drug discovery, diagnostics, environmental science, and synthetic biology. A primary bottleneck is that standard structure elucidation technologies are limited to identifying only those molecules that are contained in databases of known spectra or molecular structures and are therefore not well suited to identifying the vast majority of potentially billions of natural metabolites, whose structures are not yet catalogued. To improve the identification of molecular structures within this vast dark chemical space, we present MS2Mol, a \textit{de novo} structure prediction model based on a generative sequence to sequence transformer. We also release EnvedaDark, a first-of-its-kind for benchmarking identification performance on unknown metabolites. EnvedaDark contains experimental mass spectra from 226 natural products not currently found in major databases. We demonstrate on this challenging dataset that MS2Mol is able to predict 21\% of molecular structures to within a close-match accuracy threshold and 62\% to within meaningful similarity, both of which are significant improvements over the closest match retrieved using standard database methods. We further present a confidence scorer that enables practical usage for novel molecule discovery and enriches the accuracy on meaningfully-similar and close-match thresholds to 98\% and 63\%, respectively, for the top 10\% most confident predictions.

MSGo	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Translating mass spectra into chemical structures is a central challenge in exposomics, making it difficult to quickly track the millions of chemicals found in humans and the environment. Unlike metabolomics, key problems in developing models for chemicals with a larger molecular space include data scarcity, model complexity and proper query strategy. Here we present a molecular structure generator (MSGo) that can generate structures directly from mass spectra and discover unknown polyfluorinated chemicals in the exposome. Trained with only virtual spectra using a transformer neural network, MSGo correctly identified 48% of structures in a validation set and was better at discovering new polyfluorinated chemicals in wastewater samples reported in the literature than experts. Applying probability-oriented masking to the virtual spectra is key to MSGo’s performance. Rapid discovery of chemicals with limited experimental mass spectral data using automated tools such as MSGo is key to tackling the current unknown polyfluorinated chemical crisis.

MSNovelist	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Current methods for structure elucidation of small molecules rely on finding similarity with spectra of known compounds, but do not predict structures de novo for unknown compound classes. We present MSNovelist, which combines fingerprint prediction with an encoder–decoder neural network to generate structures de novo solely from tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) spectra. In an evaluation with 3,863 MS2 spectra from the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking site, MSNovelist predicted 25% of structures correctly on first rank, retrieved 45% of structures overall and reproduced 61% of correct database annotations, without having ever seen the structure in the training phase. Similarly, for the CASMI 2016 challenge, MSNovelist correctly predicted 26% and retrieved 57% of structures, recovering 64% of correct database annotations. Finally, we illustrate the application of MSNovelist in a bryophyte MS2 dataset, in which de novo structure prediction substantially outscored the best database candidate for seven spectra. MSNovelist is ideally suited to complement library-based annotation in the case of poorly represented analyte classes and novel compounds.

OMG	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Despite the size increase in spectral reference libraries and available annotation tools, the rate of assigning molecular structures to tandem mass spectra remains low. As not all chemical products are known nor cataloged in databases, generative AI models are poised to address this gap through de novo structural candidate generation. We develop a novel method, Optimized Molecular Generation (OMG), for de novo molecular generation for mass spectra annotation. OMG comprises two steps: molecular generation and candidate ranking. During molecular generation, we finetune a prior unbiased molecular generation model using transfer learning on molecules retrieved from PubChem based on a target molecular formula. Using reinforcement learning, we utilize custom scoring functions to create a curriculum-learning scheme that guides the generation of novel molecular candidates for a queried spectrum. After sampling the finetuned model, we rank the generated candidate structures. OMG finetunes REINVENT4’s pretrained molecular generator and ranks generated molecules using two recent ranking models, JESTR and ESP. We evaluate OMG on the CANOPUS and MassSpecGym data sets, for which OMG achieves 10.51 and 2.42% for top-1 accuracy, respectively, therefore outperforming current baselines. Our work highlights the promise of utilizing transfer and reinforcement learning in guiding de novo generation for spectra annotation.

One Small Step / MIST + MolForge pipeline	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	A common approach to the de novo molecular generation problem from mass spectra involves a two-stage pipeline: (1) encoding mass spectra into molecular fingerprints, followed by (2) decoding these fingerprints into molecular structures. In our work, we adopt MIST (Goldman et. al., 2023) as the encoder and MolForge (Ucak et. al., 2023) as the decoder, leveraging additional training data to enhance performance. We also threshold the probabilities of each fingerprint bit to focus on the presence of substructures. This results in a tenfold improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods, generating top-1 31% / top-10 40% of molecular structures correctly from mass spectra in MassSpecGym (Bushuiev et. al., 2024). We position this as a strong baseline for future research in de novo molecule elucidation from mass spectra.

SEISMiQ 	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an essential analytical technique in the pharmaceutical industry, used particularly for elucidating the structure of unknown impurities in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, the interpretation of mass spectra is challenging and time-consuming, requiring significant expertise. While recent computational tools aimed at automating this process have been developed, their accuracy in determining the chemical structure is limited. In this paper, we introduce a new method for elucidating unknown impurities from their MS/MS spectra. We are able to significantly improve elucidation accuracy by integrating domain experts’ knowledge, specifically the impurity sum formula and known substructure, into the model's training and inference process. Further performance improvements can be achieved through transfer learning from simulated MS/MS spectra of impurities from an in-house database. Finally, the need for any experimental data collection for finetuning can be circumvented by simulating the entire drug substance synthesis process in silico via reaction templates.

Spec2Mol	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Elucidating the structure of a chemical compound is a fundamental task in chemistry with applications in multiple domains including drug discovery, precision medicine, and biomarker discovery. The common practice for elucidating the structure of a compound is to obtain a mass spectrum and subsequently retrieve its structure from spectral databases. However, these methods fail for novel molecules that are not present in the reference database. We propose Spec2Mol, a deep learning architecture for molecular structure recommendation given mass spectra alone. Spec2Mol is inspired by the Speech2Text deep learning architectures for translating audio signals into text. Our approach is based on an encoder-decoder architecture. The encoder learns the spectra embeddings, while the decoder, pre-trained on a massive dataset of chemical structures for translating between different molecular representations, reconstructs SMILES sequences of the recommended chemical structures. We have evaluated Spec2Mol by assessing the molecular similarity between the recommended structures and the original structure. Our analysis showed that Spec2Mol is able to identify the presence of key molecular substructures from its mass spectrum, and shows on par performance, when compared to existing fragmentation tree methods particularly when test structure information is not available during training or present in the reference database. Identification of chemical compounds, present in a sample, is a fundamental task of chemical analysis, but matching obtained spectra with chemical databases is limited to identifying known molecules. Here, the authors report a deep learning architecture for recommending molecular structures, including those of novel molecules, given sample mass spectra alone.

TeFT	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Structural annotation of small molecules in tandem mass spectrometry has always been a central challenge in mass spectrometry analysis, especially using a miniaturized mass spectrometer for on-site testing. Here, we propose the Transformer enabled Fragment Tree (TeFT) method, which combines various types of fragmentation tree models and a deep learning Transformer module. It is aimed to generate the specific structure of molecules de novo solely from mass spectrometry spectra. The evaluation results on different open-source databases indicated that the proposed model achieved remarkable results in that the majority of molecular structures of compounds in the test can be successfully recognized. Also, the TeFT has been validated on a miniaturized mass spectrometer with low-resolution spectra for 16 flavonoid alcohols, achieving complete structure prediction for 8 substances. Finally, TeFT confirmed the structure of the compound contained in a Chinese medicine substance called the Anweiyang capsule. These results indicate that the TeFT method is suitable for annotating fragmentation peaks with clear fragmentation rules, particularly when applied to on-site mass spectrometry with lower mass resolution.

Test-Time Tuned Language Models	Annotation	De Novo Generation	Yes	Tandem Mass Spectrometry enables the identification of unknown compounds in crucial fields such as metabolomics, natural product discovery and environmental analysis. However, current methods rely on database matching from previously observed molecules, or on multi-step pipelines that require intermediate fragment or fingerprint prediction. This makes finding the correct molecule highly challenging, particularly for compounds absent from reference databases. We introduce a framework that, by leveraging test-time tuning, enhances the learning of a pre-trained transformer model to address this gap, enabling end-to-end de novo molecular structure generation directly from the tandem mass spectra and molecular formulae, bypassing manual annotations and intermediate steps. We surpass the de-facto state-of-the-art approach DiffMS on two popular benchmarks NPLIB1 and MassSpecGym by 100% and 20%, respectively. Test-time tuning on experimental spectra allows the model to dynamically adapt to novel spectra, and the relative performance gain over conventional fine-tuning is of 62% on MassSpecGym. When predictions deviate from the ground truth, the generated molecular candidates remain structurally accurate, providing valuable guidance for human interpretation and more reliable identification.

3DMolMS	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Motivation  Tandem mass spectrometry is an essential technology for characterizing chemical compounds at high sensitivity and throughput, and is commonly adopted in many fields. However, computational methods for automated compound identification from their MS/MS spectra are still limited, especially for novel compounds that have not been previously characterized. In recent years, in silico methods were proposed to predict the MS/MS spectra of compounds, which can then be used to expand the reference spectral libraries for compound identification. However, these methods did not consider the compounds’ 3D conformations, and thus neglected critical structural information. Results  We present the 3D Molecular Network for Mass Spectra Prediction (3DMolMS), a deep neural network model to predict the MS/MS spectra of compounds from their 3D conformations. We evaluated the model on the experimental spectra collected in several spectral libraries. The results showed that 3DMolMS predicted the spectra with the average cosine similarity of 0.691 and 0.478 with the experimental MS/MS spectra acquired in positive and negative ion modes, respectively. Furthermore, 3DMolMS model can be generalized to the prediction of MS/MS spectra acquired by different labs on different instruments through minor fine-tuning on a small set of spectra. Finally, we demonstrate that the molecular representation learned by 3DMolMS from MS/MS spectra prediction can be adapted to enhance the prediction of chemical properties such as the elution time in the liquid chromatography and the collisional cross section measured by ion mobility spectrometry, both of which are often used to improve compound identification.

CFM-ID 4.0	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	In the field of metabolomics, mass spectrometry (MS) is the method most commonly used for identifying and annotating metabolites. As this typically involves matching a given MS spectrum against an experimentally acquired reference spectral library, this approach is limited by the coverage and size of such libraries (which typically number in the thousands). These experimental libraries can be greatly extended by predicting the MS spectra of known chemical structures (which number in the millions) to create computational reference spectral libraries. To facilitate the generation of predicted spectral reference libraries, we developed CFM-ID, a computer program that can accurately predict ESI-MS/MS spectrum for a given compound structure. CFM-ID is one of the best-performing methods for compound-to-mass-spectrum prediction and also one of the top tools for in silico mass-spectrum-to-compound identification. This work improves CFM-ID’s ability to predict ESI-MS/MS spectra from compounds by (1) learning parameters from features based on the molecular topology, (2) adding a new approach to ring cleavage that models such cleavage as a sequence of simple chemical bond dissociations, and (3) expanding its hand-written rule-based predictor to cover more chemical classes, including acylcarnitines, acylcholines, flavonols, flavones, flavanones, and flavonoid glycosides. We demonstrate that this new version of CFM-ID (version 4.0) is significantly more accurate than previous CFM-ID versions in terms of both EI-MS/MS spectral prediction and compound identification.

DeepCDM	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Chemical derivatization is a powerful strategy to enhance sensitivity and selectivity of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry for non-targeted analysis of chemicals in complex mixtures. However, it remains impossible to obtain large sets of reference spectra for chemically derived molecules (CDMs), representing a major barrier in real-world applications. Herein, we describe a deep learning approach that enables accurate prediction of electrospray ionization tandem mass spectra for CDMs (DeepCDM). DeepCDM is established by transfer learning from a generic spectrum predicting model using a small set of experimentally acquired tandem mass spectra of CDMs, which converts a generic model with low predictability for CDMs into a specialized model with high predictability. We demonstrate DeepCDM by predicting electrospray ionization tandem mass spectra of dansylated molecules. The success in establishing Dns-MS further enables the development of DnsBank, a dansylation-specialized in silico spectral library. DnsBank achieves significant increases of accurate annotation rates of dansylated molecules, facilitating discovery of new hazardous pollutants from an environmental study of leather industrial wastewater. DeepCDM is also highly versatile for other classes of CDMs. Therefore, we envision that DeepCDM will pave a way for high-throughput identification of CDMs in non-targeted analysis to dig unknowns with potential health impacts from emerging anthropogenic chemicals.

ESP	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Motivation A key challenge in metabolomics is annotating measured spectra from a biological sample with chemical identities. Currently, only a small fraction of measurements can be assigned identities. Two complementary computational approaches have emerged to address the annotation problem: mapping candidate molecules to spectra, and mapping query spectra to molecular candidates. In essence, the candidate molecule with the spectrum that best explains the query spectrum is recommended as the target molecule. Despite candidate ranking being fundamental in both approaches, limited prior works incorporated rank learning tasks in determining the target molecule. Results We propose a novel machine learning model, Ensemble Spectral Prediction (ESP), for metabolite annotation. ESP takes advantage of prior neural network-based annotation models that utilize multilayer perceptron (MLP) networks and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs). Based on the ranking results of the MLP- and GNN-based models, ESP learns a weighting for the outputs of MLP and GNN spectral predictors to generate a spectral prediction for a query molecule. Importantly, training data is stratified by molecular formula to provide candidate sets during model training. Further, baseline MLP and GNN models are enhanced by considering peak dependencies through label mixing and multi-tasking on spectral topic distributions. When trained on the NIST 2020 dataset and evaluated on the relevant candidate sets from PubChem, ESP improves average rank by 23.7% and 37.2% over the MLP and GNN baselines, respectively, demonstrating performance gain over state-of-the-art neural network approaches. However, MLP approaches remain strong contenders when considering top five ranks. Importantly, we show that annotation performance is dependent on the training dataset, the number of molecules in the candidate set and candidate similarity to the target molecule.

FIORA	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Non-targeted metabolomics holds great promise for advancing precision medicine and biomarker discovery. However, identifying compounds from tandem mass spectra remains a challenging task due to the incomplete nature of spectral reference libraries. Augmenting these libraries with simulated mass spectra can provide the necessary references to resolve unmatched spectra, but generating high-quality data is difficult. In this study, we present FIORA, an open-source graph neural network designed to simulate tandem mass spectra. Our main contribution lies in utilizing the molecular neighborhood of bonds to learn breaking patterns and derive fragment ion probabilities. FIORA not only surpasses state-of-the-art fragmentation algorithms, ICEBERG and CFM-ID, in prediction quality, but also facilitates the prediction of additional features, such as retention time and collision cross section. Utilizing GPU acceleration, FIORA enables rapid validation of putative compound annotations and large-scale expansion of spectral reference libraries with high-quality predictions. FIORA, an advanced graph neural network, enhances the simulation of tandem mass spectra by learning molecular bond-breaking patterns. The open-source algorithm generates high-quality reference spectra for compound identification in metabolomics.

fragnnet	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Compound identification from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data is a critical step in the analysis of complex mixtures. Typical solutions for the MS/MS spectrum to compound (MS2C) problem involve comparing the unknown spectrum against a library of known spectrum-molecule pairs, an approach that is limited by incomplete library coverage. Compound to MS/MS spectrum (C2MS) models can improve retrieval rates by augmenting real libraries with predicted MS/MS spectra. Unfortunately, many existing C2MS models suffer from problems with mass accuracy, generalization, or interpretability. We develop a new probabilistic method for C2MS prediction, FraGNNet, that can efficiently and accurately simulate MS/MS spectra with high mass accuracy. Our approach formulates the C2MS problem as learning a distribution over molecule fragments. FraGNNet achieves state-of-the-art performance in terms of prediction error and surpasses existing C2MS models as a tool for retrieval-based MS2C.

GrAFF-MS	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Identifying a small molecule from its mass spectrum is the primary open problem in computational metabolomics. This is typically cast as information retrieval: an unknown spectrum is matched against spectra predicted computationally from a large database of chemical structures. However, current approaches to spectrum prediction model the output space in ways that force a tradeoff between capturing high resolution mass information and tractable learning. We resolve this tradeoff by casting spectrum prediction as a mapping from an input molecular graph to a probability distribution over chemical formulas. We further discover that a large corpus of mass spectra can be closely approximated using a fixed vocabulary constituting only 2% of all observed formulas. This enables efficient spectrum prediction using an architecture similar to graph classification - GrAFF-MS - achieving significantly lower prediction error and greater retrieval accuracy than previous approaches.

HDSE-MS	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a core technology for  small molecule structural elucidation in nontargeted metabolomics. However,   the  limited coverage of experimental spectral libraries presents a major   challenge to  MS-based small molecule identification. Although spectrum prediction methods  offer a promising alternative, existing approaches often suffer from   limitations in  combinatorial enumeration strategies or insufficient molecular   representation  capabilities, leading to poor generalizability. To address this, we propose   HDSE-  MS, an MS/MS spectrum prediction model that integrates a message passing  neural network (MPNN) with a Transformer architecture enhanced by  hierarchical distance structural encoding (HDSE). By applying graph   coarsening,  the model transforms molecular graphs into multilevel cluster structures and  encodes the hierarchical distances between clusters as structural biases in   the  Transformer. This enables the joint modeling of molecular substructures,   their  hierarchical relationships, and long-range dependencies, thereby improving   the model’s ability to represent complex molecular  structures. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation of HDSE-MS on three   benchmark data sets: NIST23, MoNA, and MassBank.  Experimental results show that HDSE-MS outperforms existing methods,   achieving mean spectral entropy similarities of 0.759,  0.567, and 0.483 under the [M + H]+ ionization mode, respectively.   Furthermore, on the external CASMI2022 test set, HDSE-MS  achieved a Rank of 220.8 and a Top-1 accuracy of 0.098, demonstrating its   strong predictive accuracy, robust generalization, and  scalability.

ICEBERG	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Structural elucidation using untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) has played a critical role in advancing scientific discovery [1, 2]. However, differentiating molecular fragmentation patterns between isobaric structures remains a prominent challenge in metabolomics [3–10], drug discovery [11–13], and reaction screening [14–17], presenting a significant barrier to the cost-effective and rapid identification of unknown molecular structures. Here, we present a geometric deep learning model, ICEBERG, that simulates collision-induced dissociation in mass spectrometry to generate chemically plausible fragments and their relative intensities with awareness of collision energies and polarities. We utilize ICEBERG predictions to facilitate structure elucidation by ranking a set of candidate structures based on the similarity between their predicted in silico MS/MS spectra and an experimental MS/MS spectrum of interest. This integrated elucidation pipeline enables state-of-the-art performance in compound annotation, with 40% top-1 accuracy on the NIST’20 [M+H]+ adduct subset and with 92% of correct structures appearing in the top ten predictions in the same dataset. We demonstrate several real-world case studies, including identifying clinical biomarkers of depression and tuberculous meningitis, annotating an aqueous abiotic degradation product of the pesticide thiophanate methyl, disambiguating isobaric products in pooled reaction screening, and annotating biosynthetic pathways in Withania somnifera. Overall, this deep learning-based, chemically-interpretable paradigm for structural elucidation enables rapid molecular annotation from complex mixtures, driving discoveries across diverse scientific domains.

MARASON	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Molecular machine learning has gained popularity with the advancements of geometric deep learning. In parallel, retrieval-augmented generation has become a principled approach commonly used with language models. However, the optimal integration of retrieval augmentation into molecular machine learning remains unclear. Graph neural networks stand to benefit from clever matching to understand the structural alignment of retrieved molecules to a query molecule. Neural graph matching offers a compelling solution by explicitly modeling node and edge affinities between two structural graphs while employing a noise-robust, end-to-end neural network to learn affinity metrics. We apply this approach to mass spectrum simulation and introduce MARASON, a novel model that incorporates neural graph matching to enhance a fragmentation-based neural network. Experimental results highlight the effectiveness of our design, with MARASON achieving 28% top-1 accuracy, a substantial improvement over the non-retrieval state-of-the-art accuracy of 19%. Moreover, MARASON outperforms both naive retrieval-augmented generation methods and traditional graph matching approaches.

MassFormer	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Tandem mass spectra capture fragmentation patterns that provide key structural information about molecules. Although mass spectrometry is applied in many areas, the vast majority of small molecules lack experimental reference spectra. For over 70 years, spectrum prediction has remained a key challenge in the field. Existing deep learning methods do not leverage global structure in the molecule, potentially resulting in difficulties when generalizing to new data. In this work we propose the MassFormer model for accurately predicting tandem mass spectra. MassFormer uses a graph transformer architecture to model long-distance relationships between atoms in the molecule. The transformer module is initialized with parameters obtained through a chemical pretraining task, then fine-tuned on spectral data. MassFormer outperforms competing approaches for spectrum prediction on multiple datasets and accurately models the effects of collision energy. Gradient-based attribution methods reveal that MassFormer can identify compositional relationships between peaks in the spectrum. When applied to spectrum identification problems, MassFormer generally surpasses the performance of existing prediction-based methods.

MassKG	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is a potent analytical technique utilized for identifying natural products from complex sources. However, due to the structural diversity, annotating LC-MS/MS data of natural products efficiently remains challenging, hindering the discovery process of novel active structures. Here, we introduce MassKG, an algorithm that combines a knowledge-based fragmentation strategy and a deep learning-based molecule generation model to aid in rapid dereplication and the discovery of novel NP structures. Specifically, MassKG has compiled 407,720 known NP structures and, based on this, generated 266,353 new structures using chemical language models for the discovery of potential novel compounds. Furthermore, MassKG demonstrates exceptional performance in spectra annotation compared to state-of-the-art algorithms. To enhance usability, MassKG has been implemented as a web server for annotating tandem mass spectral data (MS/MS, MS2) with a user-friendly interface, automatic reporting, and fragment tree visualization. Lastly, the interpretive capability of MassKG is comprehensively validated through composition analysis and MS annotation of Panax notoginseng, Ginkgo biloba, Codonopsis pilosula, and Astragalus membranaceus.

MoMS-Net	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Mass spectra, which are agglomerations of ionized fragments from targeted molecules, play a crucial role across various fields for the identification of molecular structures. A prevalent analysis method involves spectral library searches, where unknown spectra are cross-referenced with a database. The effectiveness of such search-based approaches, however, is restricted by the scope of the existing mass spectra database, underscoring the need to expand the database via mass spectra prediction. In this research, we propose the Motif-based Mass Spectrum prediction Network (MoMS-Net), a GNN-based architecture to predict the mass spectra pattern utilizing the structural motif information of the molecule. MoMS-Net considers both a molecule and its substructures as a graph form, which facilitates the incorporation of long-range dependencies while using less memory compared to the graph transformer model. We evaluated our model over various types of mass spectra and showed the validity and superiority over the conventional models.

ms-pred	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Computational predictions of mass spectra from molecules have enabled the discovery of clinically relevant metabolites. However, such predictive tools are still limited as they occupy one of two extremes, either operating (a) by fragmenting molecules combinatorially with overly rigid constraints on potential rearrangements and poor time complexity or (b) by decoding lossy and nonphysical discretized spectra vectors. In this work, we use a new intermediate strategy for predicting mass spectra from molecules by treating mass spectra as sets of molecular formulae, which are themselves multisets of atoms. After first encoding an input molecular graph, we decode a set of molecular subformulae, each of which specify a predicted peak in the mass spectrum, the intensities of which are predicted by a second model. Our key insight is to overcome the combinatorial possibilities for molecular subformulae by decoding the formula set using a prefix tree structure, atom-type by atom-type, representing a general method for ordered multiset decoding. We show promising empirical results on mass spectra prediction tasks.

NPS-MS	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	The market for illicit drugs has been reshaped by the emergence of more than 1100 new psychoactive substances (NPS) over the past decade, posing a major challenge to the forensic and toxicological laboratories tasked with detecting and identifying them. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the primary method used to screen for NPS within seized materials or biological samples. The most contemporary workflows necessitate labor-intensive and expensive MS/MS reference standards, which may not be available for recently emerged NPS on the illicit market. Here, we present NPS-MS, a deep learning method capable of accurately predicting the MS/MS spectra of known and hypothesized NPS from their chemical structures alone. NPS-MS is trained by transfer learning from a generic MS/MS prediction model on a large data set of MS/MS spectra. We show that this approach enables a more accurate identification of NPS from experimentally acquired MS/MS spectra than any existing method. We demonstrate the application of NPS-MS to identify a novel derivative of phencyclidine (PCP) within an unknown powder seized in Denmark without the use of any reference standards. We anticipate that NPS-MS will allow forensic laboratories to identify more rapidly both known and newly emerging NPS. NPS-MS is available as a web server at https://nps-ms.ca/, which provides MS/MS spectra prediction capabilities for given NPS compounds. Additionally, it offers MS/MS spectra identification against a vast database comprising approximately 8.7 million predicted NPS compounds from DarkNPS and 24.5 million predicted ESI-QToF-MS/MS spectra for these compounds.

PPGB-MS2	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics identification relies heavily on high-quality MS/MS data; MS/MS prediction is a good way to address this issue. However, the accuracy of the prediction, resolution, and correlation with chemical structures have not been well-solved. In this study, we have developed a MS/MS prediction method, PPGB-MS2, which transforms the MS/MS prediction into fragment intensity prediction, and the concept of precursor-product ion pair graph bags (PPGBs) was introduced to represent fragments, achieving uniform representation of precursor and product ion structures and MS/MS fragmentation information. The chemical structure information is kept before it is incorporated into machine learning models. Due to the PPGB representation, graph neural networks (GNNs) can be utilized to achieve MS/MS fragment intensity prediction. The system was trained and evaluated using [M+H]+ and [M-H]- data acquired by an Agilent QTOF 6530 in the NIST 20 tandem MS database. Results demonstrated that the average cosine similarity is 0.71 in the test set, which is higher than classical MS/MS prediction methods. PPGB-MS2 also achieves high-resolution MS/MS prediction due to its effective management of the correspondence between fragments and structures.

QC-GN2oMS2	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Predicting the mass spectrum of a molecular ion is often accomplished via three generalized approaches: rules-based methods for bond breaking, deep learning, or quantum chemical (QC) modeling. Rules-based approaches are often limited by the conditions for different chemical subspaces and perform poorly under chemical regimes with few defined rules. QC modeling is theoretically robust but requires significant amounts of computational time to produce a spectrum for a given target. Among deep learning techniques, graph neural networks (GNNs) have performed better than previous work with fingerprint-based neural networks in mass spectra prediction. To explore this technique further, we investigate the effects of including quantum chemically derived information as edge features in the GNN to increase predictive accuracy. The models we investigated include categorical bond order, bond force constants derived from extended tight-binding (xTB) quantum chemistry, and acyclic bond dissociation energies. We evaluated these models against a control GNN with no edge features in the input graphs. Bond dissociation enthalpies yielded the best improvement with a cosine similarity score of 0.462 relative to the baseline model (0.437). In this work we also apply dynamic graph attention which improves performance on benchmark problems and supports the inclusion of edge features. Between implementations, we investigate the nature of the molecular embedding for spectra prediction and discuss the recognition of fragment topographies in distinct chemistries for further development in tandem mass spectrometry prediction.

SingleFrag	Annotation	Spectrum prediction	Yes	Metabolite and small molecule identification via MS/MS involves matching experimental spectra with prerecorded spectra of known compounds. This process is hindered by the current lack of comprehensive reference spectral libraries. To address this gap, we need accurate in silico fragmentation tools for predicting MS/MS spectra of compounds for which empirical spectra do not exist. Here, we present SingleFrag, a novel deep learning tool that predicts individual fragments separately, rather than attempting to predict the entire fragmentation spectrum at once. Our results demonstrate that SingleFrag surpasses state-of-the-art in silico fragmentation tools, providing a powerful method for annotating unknown MS/MS spectra of known compounds. As a proof of concept, we successfully annotate three previously unidentified compounds frequently found in human samples.

ChemEmbed	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Machine learning tools have become essential for annotating the vast number of unidentified MS/MS spectra in metabolomics, addressing the limitations of current reference spectral libraries. However, these tools often struggle with the high dimensionality and sparsity of MS/MS spectra and metabolite structures. ChemEmbed introduces a novel approach by combining multidimensional and continuous vector representations of chemical structures with enhanced MS/MS spectra. This enhancement is achieved by merging spectra from multiple collision energies and incorporating calculated neutral losses from 38,472 distinct compounds, providing richer input for a convolutional neural network (CNN). ChemEmbed achieves top-ranked candidate annotations in over 42% of cases and identifies the correct compound within the top five in more than 76% of cases in a test dataset. Against external benchmarks such as CASMI 2016 and 2022, ChemEmbed outperforms SIRIUS, the current state-of-the-art in computational metabolomics. In a validation experiment with the Annotated Recurrent Unidentified Spectra (ARUS) dataset— including over 25,000 spectra from human plasma and 68,000 from urine— ChemEmbed successfully identified 24 previously unannotated compounds. By aligning with the advanced capabilities of modern mass spectrometry instrumentation, ChemEmbed balances accuracy, computational efficiency, and scalability, making it a powerful solution for high-throughput metabolomics applications.

CLERMS	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) shows great promise in the research of metabolomics, providing an abundance of information on compounds. Due to the rapid development of mass spectrometric techniques, a large number of MS/MS spectral data sets have been produced from different experimental environments. The massive data brings great challenges into the spectral analysis including compound identification and spectra clustering. The core challenge in MS/MS spectral analysis is how to describe a spectrum more quantitatively and effectively. Recently, emerging deep-learning-based technologies have brought new opportunities to handle this challenge in which high-quality descriptions of MS/MS spectra can be obtained. In this study, we propose a novel contrastive learning-based method for the representation of MS/MS spectra, called CLERMS, which is based on transformer architecture. Specifically, an optimized model architecture equipped with a sinusoidal embedder and a novel loss function composed of InfoNCE loss and MSE loss has been proposed for the attainment of good embedding from the peak information and the metadata. We evaluate our method using a GNPS data set, and the results demonstrate that the learned embedding can not only distinguish spectra from different compounds but also reveal the structural similarity between them. Additionally, the comparison between our method and other methods on the performance of compound identification and spectra clustering shows that our method can achieve significantly better results.

DeepMASS	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Untargeted analysis using liquid chromatography□mass spectrometry (LC-MS) allows quantification of known and unknown compounds within biological systems. However, in practical analysis of complex biological system, the majority of compounds often remain unidentified. Here, we developed a novel deep learning-based compound annotation approach via semantic similarity analysis of mass spectral language. This approach enables the prediction of structurally related compounds for unknowns. By considering the chemical space, these structurally related compounds provide valuable information about the potential location of the unknown compounds and assist in ranking candidates obtained from molecular structure databases. Validated with two independent benchmark datasets obtained by chemical standards, our method has consistently demonstrated superior performance compared to existing compound annotation methods. A case study of the tomato ripening process indicates that DeepMASS has significant potential for metabolic biomarker identification in real biological systems. Overall, the presented method shows considerable promise in annotating metabolites, particularly in revealing the “dark matter” in untargeted analysis.

DreaMS	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Characterizing biological and environmental samples at a molecular level primarily uses tandem mass spectroscopy (MS/MS), yet the interpretation of tandem mass spectra from untargeted metabolomics experiments remains a challenge. Existing computational methods for predictions from mass spectra rely on limited spectral libraries and on hard-coded human expertise. Here we introduce a transformer-based neural network pre-trained in a self-supervised way on millions of unannotated tandem mass spectra from our GNPS Experimental Mass Spectra (GeMS) dataset mined from the MassIVE GNPS repository. We show that pre-training our model to predict masked spectral peaks and chromatographic retention orders leads to the emergence of rich representations of molecular structures, which we named Deep Representations Empowering the Annotation of Mass Spectra (DreaMS). Further fine-tuning the neural network yields state-of-the-art performance across a variety of tasks. We make our new dataset and model available to the community and release the DreaMS Atlas—a molecular network of 201 million MS/MS spectra constructed using DreaMS annotations.

LSM1-MS2	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	We introduce LSM1-MS2, a self-supervised foundation model pre-trained on extensive unlabeled MS2 data for tandem mass spectrometry. LSM1-MS2 leverages the complex data within MS2 spectra, bypassing the need for detailed identification and efficiently processing traditional MS2 data. The model's architecture, based on a specialized transformer and custom tokenization scheme, enables Masked Peak Modeling, which trains the model to reconstruct MS2 peaks, preparing it for various downstream applications. Fine-tuning LSM1-MS2 with a smaller, labeled dataset focuses on compound property prediction and identification through spectral matching, enhancing its practicality. Preliminary results demonstrate that the model predicts 209 RDKIT-extracted descriptors with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 3.35 on the CASMI 2022 dataset, outperforming recent supervised models. Notably, it requires only 1% of the labeled data used by traditional methods. LSM1-MS2's rich embeddings yield similar results to supervised models even without fine-tuning. In compound identification, LSM1-MS2 excels in database lookups, achieving a 0.07 MAE in Tanimoto similarity measurements on CASMI 2022, surpassing supervised models and traditional methods. It also retrieves close matches for known and unknown molecule queries more efficiently than conventional approaches. Overall, LSM1-MS2 demonstrates a transformative impact on mass spectrometry analysis, offering effective fine-tuning with minimal data and robust predictive abilities, reshaping traditional approaches in MS2 data utilization.

MS2DeepScore	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Mass spectrometry data is one of the key sources of information in many workflows in medicine and across the life sciences. Mass fragmentation spectra are generally considered to be characteristic signatures of the chemical compound they originate from, yet the chemical structure itself usually cannot be easily deduced from the spectrum. Often, spectral similarity measures are used as a proxy for structural similarity but this approach is strongly limited by a generally poor correlation between both metrics. Here, we propose MS2DeepScore: a novel Siamese neural network to predict the structural similarity between two chemical structures solely based on their MS/MS fragmentation spectra. Using a cleaned dataset of > 100,000 mass spectra of about 15,000 unique known compounds, we trained MS2DeepScore to predict structural similarity scores for spectrum pairs with high accuracy. In addition, sampling different model varieties through Monte-Carlo Dropout is used to further improve the predictions and assess the model’s prediction uncertainty. On 3600 spectra of 500 unseen compounds, MS2DeepScore is able to identify highly-reliable structural matches and to predict Tanimoto scores for pairs of molecules based on their fragment spectra with a root mean squared error of about 0.15. Furthermore, the prediction uncertainty estimate can be used to select a subset of predictions with a root mean squared error of about 0.1. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MS2DeepScore outperforms classical spectral similarity measures in retrieving chemically related compound pairs from large mass spectral datasets, thereby illustrating its potential for spectral library matching. Finally, MS2DeepScore can also be used to create chemically meaningful mass spectral embeddings that could be used to cluster large numbers of spectra. Added to the recently introduced unsupervised Spec2Vec metric, we believe that machine learning-supported mass spectral similarity measures have great potential for a range of metabolomics data processing pipelines.

MS2DeepScore 2.0	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Mass spectrometry is a cornerstone of untargeted metabolomics, enabling the characterization of metabolites in both positive and negative ionization modes. However, comparisons across ionization modes have remained a substantial challenge due to the distinct fragmentation patterns produced by each polarity. To overcome this barrier, we present MS2DeepScore 2.0, a machine learning-based model to predict chemical similarity between mass fragmentation spectra, which works both between different and the same ionization modes. We demonstrate the utility of MS2DeepScore 2.0 in three case studies, where MS2DeepScore enabled cross-ionization mode molecular networking, enhancing data exploration and metabolite annotation. To ensure robustness, we have implemented a quality estimation method that flags spectra with low information content or those dissimilar to the training data, thereby minimizing false predictions. Altogether, MS2DeepScore 2.0 extends our current capabilities in organizing, exploring, and annotating untargeted metabolomics profiles.

MSBERT	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a powerful technique for chemical analysis in many areas of science. The vast MS/MS spectral data generated in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) experiments require efficient analysis and interpretation methods for the following compound identification. In this study, we propose MSBERT based on self-supervised learning strategies to embed MS/MS spectra into reasonable embeddings for efficient compound identification. It adopts the transformer encoder as the backbone for mask learning and uses the same spectra with different masks for contrastive learning. MSBERT is trained on the GNPS data set and tested on the GNPS data set, the MoNA data set, and the MTBLS1572 data set. It exhibits enhanced library matching and analogous compound searching capabilities compared to existing methods. The recalls at 1, 5, and 10 on a GNPS test subset with structures not in the training set are 0.7871, 0.8950, and 0.9080, respectively.

NaFM	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Natural products, as metabolites from microorganisms, animals, or plants, exhibit diverse biological activities, making them crucial for drug discovery. Nowadays, existing deep learning methods for natural products research primarily rely on supervised learning approaches designed for specific downstream tasks. However, such one-model-for-a-task paradigm often lacks generalizability and leaves significant room for performance improvement. Additionally, existing molecular characterization methods are not well-suited for the unique tasks associated with natural products. To address these limitations, we have pre-trained a foundation model for natural products based on their unique properties. Our approach employs a novel pretraining strategy that is especially tailored to natural products. By incorporating contrastive learning and masked graph learning objectives, we emphasize evolutional information from molecular scaffolds while capturing side-chain information. Our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results in various downstream tasks related to natural product mining and drug discovery. We first compare taxonomy classification with synthesized molecule-focused baselines to demonstrate that current models are inadequate for understanding natural synthesis. Furthermore, by diving into a fine-grained analysis at both the gene and microbial levels, NaFM demonstrates the ability to capture evolutionary information. Eventually, our method is experimented with virtual screening, illustrating informative natural product representations that can lead to more effective identification of potential drug candidates.

Spec2Vec	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Spectral similarity is used as a proxy for structural similarity in many tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based metabolomics analyses such as library matching and molecular networking. Although weaknesses in the relationship between spectral similarity scores and the true structural similarities have been described, little development of alternative scores has been undertaken. Here, we introduce Spec2Vec, a novel spectral similarity score inspired by a natural language processing algorithm—Word2Vec. Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities. Using data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries including spectra for nearly 13,000 unique molecules, we show how Spec2Vec scores correlate better with structural similarity than cosine-based scores. We demonstrate the advantages of Spec2Vec in library matching and molecular networking. Spec2Vec is computationally more scalable allowing structural analogue searches in large databases within seconds.

SpecEmbedding	Annotation	Learned spectrum representations	Yes	Over the past decades, mass spectrometry has served as a fundamental technique for molecular identification in the field of metabolomics, widely applied to the analysis and characterization of biomolecules. However, the complexity of experimental conditions and the structural similarities among compounds pose significant challenges for accurate identification. Recent advancements in deep learning have offered new solutions to address these challenges, particularly demonstrating great potential in generating high-quality spectral embeddings. In this study, we propose a novel method, SpecEmbedding, which leverages a transformer encoder architecture and employs replicated spectra of compounds as positive samples, trained under a supervised contrastive learning framework. By mapping complex mass spectra into low-dimensional vector representations, SpecEmbedding significantly enhances the comparability between spectra, thereby improving identification accuracy. We trained SpecEmbedding on the GNPS training subset and evaluated its performance on the GNPS test subset, the MoNA data set, and the MTBLS1572 data set. Experimental results show that SpecEmbedding achieves a Top-1 hit ratio of 81.73% on the GNPS test subset, substantially outperforming MSBERT (77.81%) and DreaMS (71.90%).

FIDDLE	Annotation	Molecular formula prediction	Yes	Molecular identification through tandem mass spectrometry is fundamental in small molecule analysis, with formula identification serving as an initial step in the process. Current computational methods often struggle with accuracy, speed, and scalability for relatively larger molecules, limiting high-throughput workflows. We present FIDDLE (Formula IDentification by Deep LEarning), a deep learning-based method trained on over 38,000 molecules and 1 million MS/MS spectra from various Quadrupole Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) and Orbitrap instruments. FIDDLE accelerates formula identification by more than 10-fold and achieves top-1 and top-5 accuracies of 88.3% and 93.6%, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art methods based on top-down (SIRIUS) and bottom-up (BUDDY) approaches by over 10%. On external metabolomics datasets, FIDDLE achieves top-5 accuracies of 75.1% (positive ion mode) and 66.2% (negative ion mode), with further improvements to 80.0% and 73.8% when combined with SIRIUS and BUDDY.

MIST-CF	Annotation	Molecular formula prediction	Yes	Chemical formula annotation for tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data is the first step toward structurally elucidating unknown metabolites. While great strides have been made toward solving this problem, the current state-of-the-art method depends on time-intensive, proprietary, and expert-parametrized fragmentation tree construction and scoring. In this work, we extend our previous spectrum Transformer methodology into an energy-based modeling framework, MIST-CF: Metabolite Inference with Spectrum Transformers for Chemical Formula prediction, for learning to rank chemical formula and adduct assignments given an unannotated MS/MS spectrum. Importantly, MIST-CF learns in a data-dependent fashion using a Formula Transformer neural network architecture and circumvents the need for fragmentation tree construction. We train and evaluate our model on a large open-access database, showing an absolute improvement of 10% top 1 accuracy over other neural network architectures. We further validate our approach on the CASMI2022 challenge data set, achieving nearly equivalent performance to the winning entry within the positive mode category without any manual curation or postprocessing of our results. These results demonstrate an exciting strategy to more powerfully leverage MS2 fragment peaks for predicting MS1 precursor chemical formulas with data-driven learning.

RASSP	Annotation	Molecular formula prediction	Yes	Mass spectrometry is a vital tool in the analytical chemist’s toolkit, commonly used to identify the presence of known compounds and elucidate unknown chemical structures. All of these applications rely on having previously measured spectra for known substances. Computational methods for predicting mass spectra from chemical structures can be used to augment existing spectral databases with predicted spectra from previously unmeasured molecules. In this paper, we present a method for prediction of electron ionization–mass spectra (EI–MS) of small molecules that combines physically plausible substructure enumeration and deep learning, which we term rapid approximate subset-based spectra prediction (RASSP). The first of our two models, FormulaNet, produces a probability distribution over chemical subformulae to achieve a state-of-the-art forward prediction accuracy of 92.9% weighted (Stein) dot product and database lookup recall (within top 10 ranked spectra) of 98.0% when evaluated against the NIST 2017 Mass Spectral Library. The second model, SubsetNet, produces a probability distribution over vertex subsets of the original molecule graph to achieve similar forward prediction accuracy and superior generalization in the high-resolution, low-data regime. Spectra predicted by our best model improve upon the previous state-of-the-art spectral database lookup error rate by a factor of 2.9×, reducing the lookup error (top 10) from 5.7 to 2.0%. Both models can train on and predict spectral data at arbitrary resolution. Source code and predicted EI–MS spectra for 73.2M small molecules from PubChem will be made freely accessible online.

CMSSP	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval	Yes	A pivotal challenge in metabolite research is the structural annotation of metabolites from tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data. The integration of artificial intelligence (AI) has revolutionized the interpretation of MS data, facilitating the identification of elusive metabolites within the metabolomics landscape. Innovative methodologies are primarily focusing on transforming MS/MS spectra or molecular structures into a unified modality to enable similarity-based comparison and interpretation. In this work, we present CMSSP, a novel Contrastive Mass Spectra-Structure Pretraining framework designed for metabolite annotation. The primary objective of CMSSP is to establish a representation space that facilitates a direct comparison between MS/MS spectra and molecular structures, transcending the limitations of distinct modalities. The evaluation on two benchmark test sets demonstrates the efficacy of the approach. CMSSP achieved a remarkable enhancement in annotation accuracy, outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by a significant margin. Specifically, it improved the top-1 accuracy by 30% on the CASMI 2017 data set and realized a 16% increase in top-10 accuracy on an independent test set. Moreover, the model displayed superior identification accuracy across all seven chemical categories, showcasing its robustness and versatility. Finally, the MS/MS data of 30 metabolites from Glycyrrhiza glabra were analyzed, achieving top-1 and top-3 accuracies of 86.7 and 100%, respectively. The CMSSP model serves as a potent tool for the dissection and interpretation of intricate MS/MS data, propelling the field toward more accurate and efficient metabolite annotation. This not only augments the analytical capabilities of metabolomics but also paves the way for future discoveries in understanding of complex biological systems.

CSU-MS2	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval	Yes	Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is a cornerstone for compound identification in complex mixtures, but conventional spectral matching approaches face critical limitations due to limited library coverage and matching algorithms. To address this, we propose CSU-MS2 (contrastively spectral-structural Unification framework for MS/MS Spectra and Molecular Structures), a novel framework that bridges MS/MS spectra and molecular structures through cross-modal contrastive learning. CSU-MS2 uniquely integrates an External Space Attention Aggregation (ESA) module to dynamically align spectral and structural features, enabling direct retrieval of molecular candidates from a unified embedding space. The framework is pretrained on large-scale in-silico MS/MS data sets generated by CFM-ID and ICEBERG, followed by fine-tuning on high-quality experimental data. Results show that CSU-MS2 achieves a Recall@1 of 75.45% when matching 1047 spectra against a reference library containing 1,001,047 compounds, significantly surpassing existing methods such as CFM-ID (68.38%), SIRIUS (64.85%), MetFrag (48.59%), and CMSSP (30.47%). Furthermore, rigorous validation on three external data sets spanning human metabolomics (MTBLS265), plant metabolites (PMhub), and the CASMI 2022 challenge demonstrates robust generalizability, with domain-specific retrieval achieving a Recall@10 of 91.67% for blood metabolites. To facilitate compound identification across various domains, we have assembled a Spectrum-searchable Structural Feature Database (SSFDB) from 23 structural databases and deployed an open-source web server supporting customizable cross-modal retrieval. All code, models, and SSFDB are publicly accessible, offering a transformative solution for high-throughput compound identification in metabolomics and beyond.

IDSL_MINT	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval	Yes	The majority of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra in untargeted metabolomics and exposomics studies lack any annotation. Our deep learning framework, Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics—Mass INTerpreter (IDSL_MINT) can translate MS/MS spectra into molecular fingerprint descriptors. IDSL_MINT allows users to leverage the power of the transformer model for mass spectrometry data, similar to the large language models. Models are trained on user-provided reference MS/MS libraries via any customizable molecular fingerprint descriptors. IDSL_MINT was benchmarked using the LipidMaps database and improved the annotation rate of a test study for MS/MS spectra that were not originally annotated using existing mass spectral libraries. IDSL_MINT may improve the overall annotation rates in untargeted metabolomics and exposomics studies.

JESTR	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval	Yes	Motivation  A major challenge in metabolomics is annotation: assigning molecular structures to mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Despite recent advances in molecule-to-spectra and in spectra-to-molecular fingerprint (FP) prediction, annotation rates remain low. Results  We introduce in this article a novel tool (JESTR) for annotation. Unlike prior approaches that “explicitly” construct molecular FPs or spectra, JESTR leverages the insight that molecules and their corresponding spectra are views of the same data and effectively embeds their representations in a joint space. Candidate structures are ranked based on cosine similarity between the embeddings of query spectrum and each candidate. We evaluate JESTR against mol-to-spec, spec-to-FP, and spec-mol matching annotation tools on four datasets. On average, for rank@[1–20], JESTR outperforms other tools by 55.5%–302.6%. We further demonstrate the strong value of regularization with candidate molecules during training, boosting rank@1 performance by 5.72% across all datasets and enhancing the model’s ability to discern between target and candidate molecules. When comparing JESTR’s performance against that of publicly available pretrained models of SIRIUS and CFM-ID on appropriate subsets of MassSpecGym dataset, JESTR outperforms these tools by 31% and 238%, respectively. Through JESTR, we offer a novel promising avenue toward accurate annotation, therefore unlocking valuable insights into the metabolome.

MIST	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval	Yes	Metabolomics studies have identified small molecules that mediate cell signaling, competition and disease pathology, in part due to large-scale community efforts to measure tandem mass spectra for thousands of metabolite standards. Nevertheless, the majority of spectra observed in clinical samples cannot be unambiguously matched to known structures. Deep learning approaches to small-molecule structure elucidation have surprisingly failed to rival classical statistical methods, which we hypothesize is due to the lack of in-domain knowledge incorporated into current neural network architectures. Here we introduce a neural network-driven workflow for untargeted metabolomics, Metabolite Inference with Spectrum Transformers (MIST), to annotate tandem mass spectra peaks with chemical structures. Unlike existing approaches, MIST incorporates domain insights into its architecture by encoding peaks with their chemical formula representations, implicitly featurizing pairwise neutral losses and training the network to additionally predict substructure fragments. MIST performs favorably compared with both standard neural architectures and the state-of-the-art kernel method on the task of fingerprint prediction for over 70% of metabolite standards and retrieves 66% of metabolites with equal or improved accuracy, with 29% strictly better. We further demonstrate the utility of MIST by suggesting potential dipeptide and alkaloid structures for differentially abundant spectra found in an inflammatory bowel disease patient cohort.

MVP	Annotation	Molecular library retrieval	Yes	Metabolomics, enabled by high-throughput mass spectrometry, promises to advance our understanding of cellular biochemistry and guide new discoveries in disease mechanisms, drug development, and personalized medicine. However, as the assignment of molecular structures to measured spectra is challenging, annotation rates remain low and hinder potential advancements. We present MultiView Projection (MVP), a novel framework for learning a joint embedding space between molecules and spectra by leveraging multiple data views: molecular graphs, molecular fingerprints, spectra, and consensus spectra. MVP builds on contrastive multiview learning to capture mutual information across views, leading to more robust and generalizable representations for spectral annotation. Unlike prior approaches that consider multiple views via concatenation or as targets of auxiliary tasks, MVP learns from all views jointly, resulting in improved molecular candidate ranking. Notably, MVP supports annotation using either individual spectra or consensus spectra, enabling flexible use of multiple measurements. On the MassSpecGym benchmark, we show that annotation using query consensus spectra significantly outperforms rank aggregation strategies based on constituent spectrum annotation. Using the consensus spectrum view, MVP achieves 35.99% and 13.96% rank@1 when retrieving candidates by mass and formula, respectively. When ranking using individual spectra, MVP demonstrates performance that is superior to or on par with existing methods, achieving 26.37% and 11.10% rank@1 for candidates by mass and formula, respectively. MVP offers a flexible, extensible foundation for learning from multiple molecule/spectra data views.

3D-MPEA	Annotation	Molecular Networking	Yes	The spectral matching strategy of MS2 fragment spectrograms serves as a ubiquitous method for compound characterization within the matrix. Nevertheless, challenges arise due to the deficiency of distinctions in spectra across instruments caused by coelution peak-derived fragments and incompleteness of the current spectral reference database, leading to dilemma of multidimensional omics annotation. The graph attention model embedded with long short-term memory was proposed as an optimized approach involving integrating similar MS2 spectra into molecular networks according to the isotopic ion peak cluster spacing features to collapse diverse ion species and expand the spectral reference library, which efficiently evaluated the substance capture capacity to 123.1% than classic substance perception tactics. The versatility and utility of the established annotation procedure were showcased in a study on the stimulation of pork mediated by 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane and enabled the global metabolite annotation from knowns to unknowns at metabolite-lipid-protein level. On the spectra for which in silico extended spectral library search provided a group truth, 83.5–117.1% accuracy surpassed 1.2–14.3% precision after manual validation. β-Ala-His dipeptidase was first evidenced as the critical node related to the transformation of α-helical (36.57 to 35.74%) to random coil (41.53 to 42.36%) mediated by 2,2-bis(4-hydroxyphenyl)propane, ultimately triggering an augment of catalytic performance, inducing a series of oxidative stress, and further intervening in the availability of animal-derived substrates. The integration of ionic fragment feature networks and long short-term memory models allows the effective annotation of recurrent unknowns in organisms and the deciphering of unacquainted matter in multiomics.	3D-MPEA: A Graph Attention Model-Guided Computational Approach for Annotating Unknown Metabolites in Interactomics via Mass Spectrometry-Focused Multilayer Molecular Networking	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c00256	Analytical Chemistry	Fan, Z., & Jia, W.

BioTransformer4.0	Annotation	Others	Yes	BioTransformer 4.0, the successor to BioTransformer 3.0, is a freely available in silico metabolism prediction tool. It integrates both knowledge-based and machine learning approaches to predict metabolites for small molecules using one of seven modules: abiotic, environmental, CYP450, phase II, enzyme commission-based, human gut microbial, and all human metabolism. It also provides a customizable sequence prediction module that allows users to simulate multi-step metabolic transformations by chaining among the first six different modules.    BioTransformer 4.0 can make predictions more efficiently and accurately than the previous version, as it includes more than 130 new reaction rules, and also an optional validation module to improve the efficiency by restricting the number of predicted metabolites, due to their similarity among real human metabolites. We evaluated its performance by running the six-step all-human metabolism prediction on the DrugBank dataset of 2,457 known biotransformations, and the PhytoHub dataset of 633 known biotransformations - achieving recall values of 87.2% (resp., 91.6%) for the DrugBank (resp., PhytoHub) datasets.

MADGEN	Annotation	Others	Yes	The annotation (assigning structural chemical identities) of MS/MS spectra remains a significant challenge due to the enormous molecular diversity in biological samples and the limited scope of reference databases. Currently, the vast majority of spectral measurements remain in the “dark chemical space” without structural annotations. To improve annotation, we propose MADGEN (Mass-spec Attends to De Novo Molecular GENeration), a scaffold-based method for de novo molecular structure generation guided by mass spectrometry data. MADGEN operates in two stages: scaffold retrieval and spectra-conditioned molecular generation starting with the scaffold. In the first stage, given an MS/MS spectrum, we formulate scaffold retrieval as a ranking problem and employ contrastive learning to align mass spectra with candidate molecular scaffolds. In the second stage, starting from the retrieved scaffold, we employ the MS/MS spectrum to guide an attention-based generative model to generate the final molecule. Our approach constrains the molecular generation search space, reducing its complexity and improving generation accuracy. We evaluate MADGEN on three datasets (NIST23, CANOPUS, and MassSpecGym) and evaluate MADGEN’s performance with a predictive scaffold retriever and with an oracle retriever. We demonstrate the effectiveness of using attention to integrate spectral information throughout the generation process to achieve strong results with the oracle retriever.

MS4MS	Annotation	Others (LLM agent)	Yes	Small molecule identification is central to research fields such as drug discovery, but in complex systems like Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM), traditional mass spectrometry analysis methods remain constrained by bottlenecks including insufficient database coverage, fragmented analysis workflows, and poor result interpretability. To address these limitations, we developed MS4MS, a large language model-driven multi-agent system that enables an end-to-end automated pipeline from raw data to small molecule identification. Validation on a public benchmark demonstrates that MS4MS achieves state-of-the-art performance in molecular formula prediction. Furthermore, its innovative small molecule identification agent enables efficient and interpretable compound elucidation. Verification using herbal extracts indicates MS4MS's outstanding performance regarding analytical coverage and the discrimination of isomers. Consequently, MS4MS offers a novel, accurate, interpretable, and high-throughput end-to-end automated strategy for small molecule identification, overcoming the analytical bottlenecks of traditional mass spectrometry in natural products and complex TCM systems.

Peak2Patch	Annotation	Others (multimodal)	Yes	Identifying molecular structure based on spectroscopic readings is a key task in a va- riety of chemical and biological applications. Common spectroscopy techniques, such as Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry (MS), provide detailed information on the structure of molecular compounds but nonetheless require expert-level knowl- edge to decode. Machine learning has emerged as a potential solution for automating structure prediction from chemical spectra, however current approaches generally fo- cus on single sensor modalities, neglecting to leverage the complementary information contained within differing spectra. In this paper, we introduce Peak2Patch, a novel approach to fusion-enhanced prediction of functional groups from IR and mass spec- tra. First, we perform a detailed comparison of backbone networks for encoding both sparse mass spectra and dense IR spectra and demonstrate the superior performance of transformer neural networks over current state-of-the-art convolutional neural net- works. Second, we evaluate three broad categories of fusion: early (raw feature), middle (deep feature), and late (decision) fusion, demonstrating the potential of a deep fea- ture fusion-based approach. Lastly, we present Peak2Patch, our attention-based fusion scheme which leverages cross-attention to mix features between encoded tokens of the two modalities. We validate our approach on a publicly available multimodal dataset of 790k simulated molecules, demonstrating a large improvement on functional group prediction over both the previous state-of-the-art and our own strong single-modal baselines.

TransExION	Annotation	Spectral similarity retrieval	Yes	Small molecule identification is a crucial task in analytical chemistry and life sciences. One of the most commonly used technologies to elucidate small molecule structures is mass spectrometry. Spectral library search of product ion spectra (MS/MS) is a popular strategy to identify or find structural analogues. This approach relies on the assumption that spectral similarity and structural similarity are correlated. However, popular spectral similarity measures, usually calculated based on identical fragment matches between the MS/MS spectra, do not always accurately reflect the structural similarity. In this study, we propose TransExION, a Transformer based Explainable similarity metric for IONS. TransExION detects related fragments between MS/MS spectra through their mass difference and uses these to estimate spectral similarity. These related fragments can be nearly identical, but can also share a substructure. TransExION also provides a post-hoc explanation of its estimation, which can be used to support scientists in evaluating the spectral library search results and thus in structure elucidation of unknown molecules. Our model has a Transformer based architecture and it is trained on the data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries. The experimental results show that it improves existing spectral similarity measures in searching and interpreting structural analogues as well as in molecular networking.

MMST	Annotation	Others (multimodal)	Yes	Validating chemical synthesis success requires confirming the desired product using various analytical techniques. While spectroscopic data collection is increasingly automated, interpreting results remains a major bottleneck, often requiring expert input. With advances in laboratory automation and high-throughput synthesis, this challenge is expected to intensify. We introduce the MultiModalSpectralTransformer (MMST), a machine learning method that predicts chemical structures directly from diverse spectral data (NMR, IR, and MS). Trained on 4 million simulated compounds, MMST achieves 72% and 80% as top-1 and top-3 accuracy, respectively. To address out-of-distribution challenges, we implemented an active learning improvement cycle that generates molecules in similar chemical spaces, enabling the model to adapt to chemical structures beyond its original training data. We demonstrate MMST's capabilities through comprehensive benchmarking across diverse molecular weight ranges and chemical spaces. Notably, despite training solely on simulated data, MMST demonstrates good performance with experimental spectra. This research represents a significant advancement in automated structure elucidation, offering a powerful and adaptable tool that bridges the gap between simulated and real-world data.

MS-Net	Annotation/Networks	Molecular networking		Abstract Confident metabolite annotation remains a critical bottleneck in untargeted LC-MS metabolomics, as experimental spectral libraries cover only 5–20% of detected features. While in silico tools generate extensive candidate lists, top-ranked predictions often fail to reflect true identities, resulting in high false annotation rates. We present MS-Net (Multi-Similarity Network-based annotation), an accessible workflow integrating mass spectral similarity networks, molecular structure similarity (Tanimoto metrics), and taxonomic knowledge to prioritize annotations within vast candidate spaces. MS-Net employs a composite Link Score combining full-molecule and scaffold Tanimoto similarities with MS/MS cosine similarity and in silico confidence metrics. High-confidence annotations seed iterative propagation throughout the network. Applied to a Cannabis sativa dataset (2,595 initial features reduced to 1,297 after filtering, from 118,000 candidates), MS-Net resolved the annotation space to 1,275 confident assignments. notably, 53% of final annotations were rescued from lower in silico ranks (2–50), demonstrating the algorithm's ability to correct ranking errors. The workflow enables reproducible, offline annotation prioritization suitable for systems biology integration.

GLMR	Benchmark/Dataset			Retrieving molecular structures from tandem mass spectra is a crucial step in rapid compound identification. Existing retrieval methods, such as traditional mass spectral library matching, suffer from limited spectral library coverage, while recent cross-modal representation learning frameworks often encounter modality misalignment, resulting in suboptimal retrieval accuracy and generalization. To address these limitations, we propose GLMR, a Generative Language Model-based Retrieval framework that mitigates the cross-modal misalignment through a two-stage process. In the pre-retrieval stage, a contrastive learning-based model identifies top candidate molecules as contextual priors for the input mass spectrum. In the generative retrieval stage, these candidate molecules are integrated with the input mass spectrum to guide a generative model in producing refined molecular structures, which are then used to re-rank the candidates based on molecular similarity. Experiments on both MassSpecGym and the proposed MassRET-20k dataset demonstrate that GLMR significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving over 40% improvement in top-1 accuracy and exhibiting strong generalizability.

MassSpecGym	Benchmark/Dataset			The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: \textit{de novo} molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community. MassSpecGym is publicly available at \url{https://github.com/pluskal-lab/MassSpecGym}.

MetaBench	Benchmark/Dataset			Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities on general text; however, their proficiency in specialized scientific domains that require deep, interconnected knowledge remains largely uncharacterized. Metabolomics presents unique challenges with its complex biochemical pathways, heterogeneous identifier systems, and fragmented databases. To systematically evaluate LLM capabilities in this domain, we introduce MetaBench, the first benchmark for metabolomics assessment. Curated from authoritative public resources, MetaBench evaluates five capabilities essential for metabolomics research: knowledge, understanding, grounding, reasoning, and research. Our evaluation of 25 open- and closed-source LLMs reveals distinct performance patterns across metabolomics tasks: while models perform well on text generation tasks, cross-database identifier grounding remains challenging even with retrieval augmentation. Model performance also decreases on long-tail metabolites with sparse annotations. With MetaBench, we provide essential infrastructure for developing and evaluating metabolomics AI systems, enabling systematic progress toward reliable computational tools for metabolomics research.

antiSMASH 8.0	Biosynthetic Gene Clusters			Microorganisms synthesize small bioactive compounds through their secondary or specialized metabolism. Those compounds play an important role in microbial interactions and soil health, but are also crucial for the development of pharmaceuticals or agrochemicals. Over the past decades, advancements in genome sequencing have enabled the identification of large numbers of biosynthetic gene clusters directly from microbial genomes. Since its inception in 2011, antiSMASH (https://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/), has become the leading tool for detecting and characterizing these gene clusters in bacteria and fungi. This paper introduces version 8 of antiSMASH, which has increased the number of detectable cluster types from 81 to 101, and has improved analysis support for terpenoids and tailoring enzymes, as well as improvements in the analysis of modular enzymes like polyketide synthases and nonribosomal peptide synthetases. These modifications keep antiSMASH up-to-date with developments in the field and extend its overall predictive capabilities for natural product genome mining.	antiSMASH 8.0: extended gene cluster detection capabilities and analyses of chemistry, enzymology, and regulation	https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/53/W1/W32/8119805	Nucleic Acids Research	Blin, K., Shaw, S., Vader, L., Szenei, J., Reitz, Z.

iPRESTO	Biosynthetic Gene Clusters			Microbial specialised metabolism is full of valuable natural products that are applied clinically, agriculturally, and industrially. The genes that encode their biosynthesis are often physically clustered on the genome in biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). Many BGCs consist of multiple groups of co-evolving genes called sub-clusters that are responsible for the biosynthesis of a specific chemical moiety in a natural product. Sub-clusters therefore provide an important link between the structures of a natural product and its BGC, which can be leveraged for predicting natural product structures from sequence, as well as for linking chemical structures and metabolomics-derived mass features to BGCs. While some initial computational methodologies have been devised for sub-cluster detection, current approaches are not scalable, have only been run on small and outdated datasets, or produce an impractically large number of possible sub-clusters to mine through. Here, we constructed a scalable method for unsupervised sub-cluster detection, called iPRESTO, based on topic modelling and statistical analysis of co-occurrence patterns of enzyme-coding protein families. iPRESTO was used to mine sub-clusters across 150,000 prokaryotic BGCs from antiSMASH-DB. After annotating a fraction of the resulting sub-cluster families, we could predict a substructure for 16% of the antiSMASH-DB BGCs. Additionally, our method was able to confirm 83% of the experimentally characterised sub-clusters in MIBiG reference BGCs. Based on iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters, we could correctly identify the BGCs for xenorhabdin and salbostatin biosynthesis (which had not yet been annotated in BGC databases), as well as propose a candidate BGC for akashin biosynthesis. Additionally, we show for a collection of 145 actinobacteria how substructures can aid in linking BGCs to molecules by correlating iPRESTO-detected sub-clusters to MS/MS-derived Mass2Motifs substructure patterns. This work paves the way for deeper functional and structural annotation of microbial BGCs by improved linking of orphan molecules to their cognate gene clusters, thus facilitating accelerated natural product discovery.	iPRESTO: Automated discovery of biosynthetic sub-clusters linked to specific natural product substructures	https://journals.plos.org/ploscompbiol/article?id=10.1371/journal.pcbi.1010462	PLOS Computational Biology	Louwen, J.

MariClus	Biosynthetic Gene Clusters			Background: The marine environment hosts the vast majority of living species and marine microbes that produce natural products with great potential in providing lead compounds for drug development. With over 70% of Earth’s surface covered in water and the high interaction rate associated with liquid environments, this has resulted in many marine natural product discoveries. Our improved understanding of the biosynthesis of these molecules, encoded by gene clusters, along with increased genomic information will aid us in uncovering even more novel compounds. Results: We introduce MariClus (https://www.mariclus.com), an online user-friendly platform for mining and visualizing marine gene clusters. The first version contains information on clusters and the predicted molecules for over 500 marine-related prokaryotes. The user-friendly interface allows scientists to easily search by species, cluster type or molecule and visualize the information in table format or graphical representation. Conclusions: This new online portal simplifies the exploration and comparison of gene clusters in marine species for scientists and assists in characterizing the bioactive molecules they produce. MariClus integrates data from public sources, like GenBank, MIBiG and PubChem, with genome mining results from antiSMASH. This allows users to access and analyze various aspects of marine natural product biosynthesis and diversity.

NPClassScore	Biosynthetic Gene Clusters			Background  It is well-known that the microbiome produces a myriad of specialised metabolites with diverse functions. To better characterise their structures and identify their producers in complex samples, integrative genome and metabolome mining is becoming increasingly popular. Metabologenomic co-occurrence-based correlation scoring methods facilitate the linking of metabolite mass fragmentation spectra (MS/MS) to their cognate biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) based on shared absence/presence patterns of metabolites and BGCs in paired omics datasets of multiple strains. Recently, these methods have been made more readily accessible through the NPLinker platform. However, co-occurrence-based approaches usually result in too many candidate links to manually validate. To address this issue, we introduce a generic feature-based correlation method that matches chemical compound classes between BGCs and MS/MS spectra. Results  To automatically reduce the long lists of potential BGC-MS/MS spectrum links, we match natural product (NP) ontologies previously independently developed for genomics and metabolomics and developed NPClassScore: an empirical class matching score that we also implemented in the NPLinker platform. By applying NPClassScore on three paired omics datasets totalling 189 bacterial strains, we show that the number of links is reduced by on average 63% as compared to using a co-occurrence-based strategy alone. We further demonstrate that 96% of experimentally validated links in these datasets are retained and prioritised when using NPClassScore. Conclusion  The matching genome-metabolome class ontologies provide a starting point for selecting plausible candidates for BGCs and MS/MS spectra based on matching chemical compound class ontologies. NPClassScore expedites genome/metabolome data integration, as relevant BGC-metabolite links are prioritised, and researchers are faced with substantially fewer proposed BGC-MS/MS links to manually inspect. We anticipate that our addition to the NPLinker platform will aid integrative omics mining workflows in discovering novel NPs and understanding complex metabolic interactions in the microbiome.

NPLinker	Biosynthetic Gene Clusters			Specialised metabolites from microbial sources are well-known for their wide range of biomedical applications, particularly as antibiotics. When mining paired genomic and metabolomic data sets for novel specialised metabolites, establishing links between Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs) and metabolites represents a promising way of finding such novel chemistry. However, due to the lack of detailed biosynthetic knowledge for the majority of predicted BGCs, and the large number of possible combinations, this is not a simple task. This problem is becoming ever more pressing with the increased availability of paired omics data sets. Current tools are not effective at identifying valid links automatically, and manual verification is a considerable bottleneck in natural product research. We demonstrate that using multiple link-scoring functions together makes it easier to prioritise true links relative to others. Based on standardising a commonly used score, we introduce a new, more effective score, and introduce a novel score using an Input-Output Kernel Regression approach. Finally, we present NPLinker, a software framework to link genomic and metabolomic data. Results are verified using publicly available data sets that include validated links.

NPOmix	Biosynthetic Gene Clusters			Microbial specialized metabolites are an important source of and inspiration for many pharmaceuticals, biotechnological products and play key roles in ecological processes. Untargeted metabolomics using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry is an efficient technique to access metabolites from fractions and even environmental crude extracts. Nevertheless, metabolomics is limited in predicting structures or bioactivities for cryptic metabolites. Efficiently linking the biosynthetic potential inferred from (meta)genomics to the specialized metabolome would accelerate drug discovery programs by allowing metabolomics to make use of genetic predictions. Here, we present a k-nearest neighbor classifier to systematically connect mass spectrometry fragmentation spectra to their corresponding biosynthetic gene clusters (independent of their chemical class). Our new pattern-based genome mining pipeline links biosynthetic genes to metabolites that they encode for, as detected via mass spectrometry from bacterial cultures or environmental microbiomes. Using paired datasets that include validated genes-mass spectral links from the Paired Omics Data Platform, we demonstrate this approach by automatically linking 18 previously known mass spectra (17 for which the biosynthesis gene clusters can be found at the MIBiG database plus palmyramide A) to their corresponding previously experimentally validated biosynthetic genes (e.g., via nuclear magnetic resonance or genetic engineering). We illustrated a computational example of how to use our Natural Products Mixed Omics (NPOmix) tool for siderophore mining that can be reproduced by the users. We conclude that NPOmix minimizes the need for culturing (it worked well on microbiomes) and facilitates specialized metabolite prioritization based on integrative omics mining.

MetDIT	Specialized		Yes	Clinical metabolomics is growing as an essential tool for precision medicine. However, classical machine learning algorithms struggle to comprehensively encode and analyze the metabolomics data due to their high dimensionality and complex intercorrelations. This article introduces a new method called MetDIT, designed to analyze intricate metabolomics data effectively using deep convolutional neural networks (CNN). MetDIT comprises two components: TransOmics and NetOmics. Since CNN models have difficulty in processing one-dimensional (1D) sequence data efficiently, we developed TransOmics, a framework that transforms sequence data into two-dimensional (2D) images while maintaining a one-to-one correspondence between the sequences and images. NetOmics, the second component, leverages a CNN architecture to extract more discriminative representations from the transformed samples. To overcome the overfitting due to the small sample size and class imbalance, we introduced a feature augmentation module (FAM) and a loss function to improve the model performance. Furthermore, we systematically optimized the model backbone and image resolution to balance the model parameters and computational costs. To demonstrate the performance of the proposed MetDIT, we conducted extensive experiments using three different clinical metabolomics data sets and achieved better classification performance than classical machine learning methods used in metabolomics, including Random Forest, SVM, XGBoost, and LightGBM. The source code is available at the GitHub repository at https://github.com/Li-OmicsLab/MetDIT, and the WebApp can be found at http://metdit.bioinformatics.vip/.

AMDB	Database			The Animal Metabolite Database (AMDB, https://amdb.online) is a freely accessible database with built-in statistical analysis tools, allowing one to browse and compare quantitative metabolomics data and raw NMR and MS data, as well as sample metadata, with a focus on the metabolite concentrations rather than on the raw data itself. AMDB also functions as a platform for the metabolomics community, providing convenient deposition and exchange of quantitative metabolomic data. To date, the majority of the data in AMDB relate to the metabolite content of the eye lens and blood of vertebrates, primarily wild species from Siberia, Russia and laboratory rodents. However, data on other tissues (muscle, heart, liver, brain, and more) are also present, and the list of species and tissues is constantly growing. Typically, every sample in AMDB contains concentrations of 60–90 of the most abundant metabolites, provided in nanomoles per gram of wet tissue weight (nmol/g). We believe that AMDB will become a widely used tool in the community, as typical metabolite baseline concentrations in tissues of animal models will aid in a wide variety of fundamental and applied scientific fields, including, but not limited to, animal modeling of human diseases, assessment of medical formulations, and evolutionary and environmental studies.

BinDiscover database	Database			Abstract Metabolomics by gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) provides a standardized and reliable platform for understanding small molecule biology. Since 2005, the West Coast Metabolomics Center at the University of California at Davis has collated GC/MS metabolomics data from over 156,000 samples and 2000 studies into the standardized BinBase database. We believe that the observations from these samples will provide meaningful insight to biologists and that our data treatment and webtool will provide insight to others who seek to standardize disparate metabolomics studies. We here developed an easy-to-use query interface, BinDiscover, to enable intuitive, rapid hypothesis generation for biologists based on these metabolomic samples. BinDiscover creates observation summaries and graphics across a broad range of species, organs, diseases, and compounds. Throughout the components of BinDiscover, we emphasize the use of ontologies to aggregate large groups of samples based on the proximity of their metadata within these ontologies. This adjacency allows for the simultaneous exploration of entire categories such as “rodents”, “digestive tract”, or “amino acids”. The ontologies are particularly relevant for BinDiscover’s ontologically grouped differential analysis, which, like other components of BinDiscover, creates clear graphs and summary statistics across compounds and biological metadata. We exemplify BinDiscover’s extensive applicability in three showcases across biological domains.

CCDB	Database			Inter-chemical correlations in metabolomics and exposomics datasets provide valuable information for studying relationships among chemicals reported for human specimens. With an increase in the number of compounds for these datasets, a network graph analysis and visualization of the correlation structure is difficult to interpret. We have developed the Chemical Correlation Database (CCDB), as a systematic catalogue of inter-chemical correlation in publicly available metabolomics and exposomics studies. The database has been provided via an online interface to create single compound-centric views. We have demonstrated various applications of the database to explore: 1) the chemicals from a chemical class such as Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), phthalates and tobacco smoke related metabolites; 2) xenobiotic metabolites such as caffeine and acetaminophen; 3) endogenous metabolites (acyl-carnitines); and 4) unannotated peaks for PFAS. The database has a rich collection of 35 human studies, including the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) and high-quality untargeted metabolomics datasets. CCDB is supported by a simple, interactive and user-friendly web-interface to retrieve and visualize the inter-chemical correlation data. The CCDB has the potential to be a key computational resource in metabolomics and exposomics facilitating the expansion of our understanding about biological and chemical relationships among metabolites and chemical exposures in the human body. The database is available at www.ccdb.idsl.me site.

COCONUT	Database			Natural products (NPs) are small molecules produced by living organisms with potential applications in pharmacology and other industries as many of them are bioactive. This potential raised great interest in NP research around the world and in different application fields, therefore, over the years a multiplication of generalistic and thematic NP databases has been observed. However, there is, at this moment, no online resource regrouping all known NPs in just one place, which would greatly simplify NPs research and allow computational screening and other in silico applications. In this manuscript we present the online version of the COlleCtion of Open Natural prodUcTs (COCONUT): an aggregated dataset of elucidated and predicted NPs collected from open sources and a web interface to browse, search and easily and quickly download NPs. COCONUT web is freely available at https://coconut.naturalproducts.net.

DNA adduct database	Database			The exposure of human DNA to genotoxic compounds induces the formation of covalent DNA adducts, which may contribute to the initiation of carcinogenesis. Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is a powerful tool for DNA adductomics, a new research field aiming at screening known and unknown DNA adducts in biological samples. The lack of databases and bioinformatics tool in this field limits the applicability of DNA adductomics. Establishing a comprehensive database will make the identification process faster and more efficient and will provide new insight into the occurrence of DNA modification from a wide range of genotoxicants. In this paper, we present a four-step approach used to compile and curate a database for the annotation of DNA adducts in biological samples. The first step included a literature search, selecting only DNA adducts that were unequivocally identified by either comparison with reference standards or with nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and tentatively identified by tandem HRMS/MS. The second step consisted in harmonizing structures, molecular formulas, and names, for building a systematic database of 279 DNA adducts. The source, the study design and the technique used for DNA adduct identification were reported. The third step consisted in implementing the database with 303 new potential DNA adducts coming from different combinations of genotoxicants with nucleobases, and reporting monoisotopic masses, chemical formulas, .cdxml files, .mol files, SMILES, InChI, InChIKey and IUPAC nomenclature. In the fourth step, a preliminary spectral library was built by acquiring experimental MS/MS spectra of 15 reference standards, generating in silico MS/MS fragments for all the adducts, and reporting both experimental and predicted fragments into interactive web datatables. The database, including 582 entries, is publicly available (https://gitlab.com/nexs-metabolomics/projects/dna_adductomics_database). This database is a powerful tool for the annotation of DNA adducts measured in (HR)MS. The inclusion of metadata indicating the source of DNA adducts, the study design and technique used, allows for prioritization of the DNA adducts of interests and/or to enhance the annotation confidence. DNA adducts identification can be further improved by integrating the present database with the generation of authentic MS/MS spectra, and with user-friendly bioinformatics tools.

EnzyMine	Database			Addition of chemical structural information in enzymatic reactions has proven to be significant for accurate enzyme function prediction. However, such chemical data lack systematic feature mining and hardly exist in enzyme-related databases. Therefore, global mining of enzymatic reactions will offer a unique landscape for researchers to understand the basic functional mechanisms of natural bioprocesses and facilitate enzyme function annotation. Here, we established a new knowledge base called EnzyMine, through which we propose to elucidate enzymatic reaction features and then link them with sequence and structural annotations. EnzyMine represents an advanced database that extends enzyme knowledge by incorporating reaction chemical feature strategies, strengthening the connectivity between enzyme and metabolic reactions. Therefore, it has the potential to reveal many new metabolic pathways involved with given enzymes, as well as expand enzyme function annotation.

foodMASST	Database			There is a growing interest in unraveling the chemical complexity of our diets. To help the scientific community gain insight into the molecules present in foods and beverages that we ingest, we created foodMASST, a search tool for MS/MS spectra (of both known and unknown molecules) against a growing metabolomics food and beverage reference database. We envision foodMASST will become valuable for nutrition research and to assess the potential uniqueness of dietary biomarkers to represent specific foods or food classes.	foodMASST a mass spectrometry search tool for foods and beverages	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41538-022-00137-3	npj Science of Food	West, K.

FragHub	Database			Open mass spectral libraries (OMSLs) are critical for metabolite annotation and machine learning, especially given the rising volume of untargeted metabolomic studies and the development of annotation pipelines. Despite their importance, the practical application of OMSLs is hampered by the lack of standardized file formats, metadata fields, and supporting ontology. Current libraries, often restricted to specific topics or matrices, such as natural products, lipids, or the human metabolome, may limit the discovery potential of untargeted studies. The goal of FragHub is to provide users with the capability to integrate various OMSLs into a single unified format, thereby enhancing the annotation accuracy and reliability. FragHub addresses these challenges by integrating multiple OMSLs into a single comprehensive database, supporting various data formats, and harmonizing metadata. It also proposes some generic filters for the mass spectrum using a graphical user interface. Additionally, a workflow to generate in-house libraries compatible with FragHub is proposed. FragHub dynamically segregates libraries based on ionization modes and chromatography techniques, thereby enhancing data utility in metabolomic research. The FragHub Python code is publicly available under a MIT license, at the following repository: https://github.com/eMetaboHUB/FragHub. Generated data can be accessed at 10.5281/zenodo.11057687.

GNPS Dashboard	Database			Access to web-based platforms has enabled scientists to perform research remotely. A critical aspect of mass spectrometry data analysis is the inspection, analysis, and visualization of the raw data to validate data quality and confirm statistical observations.

HMDB 5.0	Database			The Human Metabolome Database or HMDB (https://hmdb.ca) has been providing comprehensive reference information about human metabolites and their associated biological, physiological and chemical properties since 2007. Over the past 15 years, the HMDB has grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in internet and computing technology. This year's update, HMDB 5.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades to the database. These should make the HMDB more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of metabolite entries (from 114 100 to 217 920 compounds); (ii) enhancements to the quality and depth of metabolite descriptions; (iii) the addition of new structure, spectral and pathway visualization tools; (iv) the inclusion of many new and much more accurately predicted spectral data sets, including predicted NMR spectra, more accurately predicted MS spectra, predicted retention indices and predicted collision cross section data and (v) enhancements to the HMDB’s search functions to facilitate better compound identification. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface, and general performance of the HMDB website have also been made. Overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance the HMDB’s ease of use and its potential applications not only in human metabolomics but also in exposomics, lipidomics, nutritional science, biochemistry and clinical chemistry.

HREI-MSDB	Database			Despite the increasing use of gas chromatography coupled with electron ionization high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-EI-HRMS), only a limited amount of GC-EI-HRMS reference data is currently available. Such data are beneficial not only in combination with a GC-EI-HRMS instrument, but also for computational purposes - for example, for training machine learning models that predict fragmentation under electron ionization conditions. Such models are currently trained and tested on integer m/z data, although they predict the exact elemental composition of ions. High-quality GC-EI-HRMS data will be able to boost the development of such models even if the end-user does not have such an instrument. We present HREI-MSDB: a GC-EI-HRMS mass spectral library with an m/z range of 40, an m/z accuracy of 0.6 mDa, and a resolution (full width at half maximum) of 30,000. The data set includes 329 mass spectra of molecules of various classes (nitrogen-containing heterocycles, aromatic and polyaromatic compounds, alcohols, phenols, and essential oil components). All mass spectra are manually verified, do not contain impurity peaks, and are of high quality. In the future, mass spectra may be posted on MassBank. The data is available online: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.29713460.

Human Hair Atlas	Database			The stable structure and growth cycle of human hair enables the accumulation of both endogenous and exogenous compounds, making hair an ideal matrix for long-term profiling. However, its exact molecular composition, shaped by root-to-tip variations, remains poorly understood. Here, we present a metabolome and lipidome atlas of human hair originating from a healthy cohort. The Human Hair Atlas maps over 1200 unique molecular species and highlights compounds prone to significant longitudinal variations. Metabolite and lipid levels vary by up to 50% along the length of the hair, underscoring the importance of accounting for segmental differences. We categorized 122 molecules as exposome-related compounds, primarily from personal care products, facilitating biological interpretation. The Human Hair Atlas is publicly accessible (https://metabolomics.cloud/hair/), providing a resource to stimulate research in hair metabolomics, lipidomics, and exposomics, and to explore the potential of hair as a complementary matrix in clinical studies.

LEAFBot	Database			Many existing mass spectral libraries focus on human or microbially derived molecules. Few plant-specific MS2 databases exist, making annotation of botanical samples difficult. To fill this gap in mass spectrometry data availability, the Library Enabling Annotation of Botanical Natural Products (LEAFBot) was constructed. Using a flow injection mass spectrometry method that allowed for rapid throughput data collection, the MS2 spectra of >300 pure botanical secondary metabolites were experimentally measured and complied into a single library housed in the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) spectral database. Of these compounds, over 20% were not present in the existing GNPS database, and 11% were not present in any of three main mass spectral databases (GNPS, Metlin, and MassBank). Additionally, LEAFBot contains a wider range of adducts compared to other plant-based mass spectral libraries, enabling more effective annotation of unknown features. The LEAFBot database represents a new resource to the mass spectrometry and metabolomics community seeking to characterize plant-based samples. The possibility of searching against a taxonomically specific library decreases the likelihood of false positives in database searches, and the ease of adding new spectra, following procedures outlined herein, will enable community-lead expansion of the database.

MarkerDB 2.0	Database			MarkerDB (https://markerdb.ca) has become a leading resource for comprehensive information on molecular biomarkers. Over the past 3 years, the database has evolved significantly, reflecting the dynamic landscape of biomarker research and increasing demands from its user community. This year’s update, which is called MarkerDB 2.0, introduces key improvements to enhance the database’s usability, consistency and the range of biomarkers covered. These improvements include (i) the addition of thousands of new biomarkers and associated health conditions, (ii) the inclusion of many new biomarker types and categories, (iii) upgraded searches and data filtering functionalities, (iv) new features for exploring and understanding biomarker panels and (v) significantly expanded and improved descriptions. These upgrades, along with numerous minor improvements in content, interface, layout and overall website performance, have greatly enhanced MarkerDB’s usability and capacity to facilitate biomarker interpretation across various research domains. MarkerDB remains committed to providing a free, publicly accessible platform for consolidated information on a wide range of molecular (protein, genetic, chromosomal and chemical/small molecule) biomarkers, covering diagnostic, prognostic, risk, monitoring, safety and response-related biomarkers. We are confident that these upgrades and updates will improve MarkerDB’s user friendliness, increase its utility and greatly expand its potential applications to many other areas of clinical medicine and biomedical research.

MassBase	Database			Depository of low-molecular-weight compounds or metabolites detected in various organisms in a non-targeted manner is indispensable for metabolomics research. Due to the diverse chemical compounds, various mass spectrometry (MS) setups with state-of-the-art technologies have been used. Over the past two decades, we have analyzed various biological samples by using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, or capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry, and archived the datasets in the depository MassBase (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/massbase/). As the format of MS datasets depends on the MS setup used, we converted each raw binary dataset of the mass chromatogram to text file format, and thereafter, information of the chromatograph peak was extracted in the text file from the converted file. In total, the depository comprises 46,493 datasets, of which 38,750 belong to the plant species and 7,743 are authentic or mixed chemicals as well as other sources (microorganisms, animals, and foods), as on August 1, 2020. All files in the depository can be downloaded in bulk from the website. Mass chromatograms of 90 plant species obtained by LC-Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS or Orbitrap MS, which detect the ionized molecules with high accuracy allowing speculation of chemical compositions, were converted to text files by the software PowerGet, and the chemical annotation of each peak was added. The processed datasets were deposited in the annotation database KomicMarket2 (http://webs2.kazusa.or.jp/km2/). The archives provide fundamental resources for comparative metabolomics and functional genomics, which may result in deeper understanding of living organisms.

MassSpecBlocks	Database			Nonribosomal peptides and polyketides are natural products commonly synthesized by microorganisms. They are widely used in medicine, agriculture, environmental protection, and other fields. The structures of natural products are often analyzed by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry, which becomes more popular with its increasing availability. However, the characterization of nonribosomal peptides and polyketides from tandem mass spectra is a nontrivial task because they are composed of many uncommon building blocks in addition to proteinogenic amino acids. Moreover, many of them have cyclic and branch-cyclic structures. Here, we introduce MassSpecBlocks – an open-source and web-based tool that converts the input chemical structures in SMILES format into sequences of building blocks. The structures can be searched in public databases PubChem, ChemSpider, ChEBI, NP Atlas, COCONUT, and Norine and edited in a user-friendly graphical interface. Although MassSpecBlocks can serve as a stand-alone database, our primary goal was to enable easy construction of custom sequence and building block databases, which can be used to annotate mass spectra in CycloBranch software. CycloBranch is an open-source, cross-platform, and stand-alone tool that we recently released for annotating spectra of linear, cyclic, branched, and branch-cyclic nonribosomal peptides and polyketide siderophores.

MCID database 	Database			Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been increasingly used for metabolome analysis. One of the critical steps in the LC-MS metabolome analysis workflow is related to metabolite identification. Among the measured parameters, peak mass is commonly used to search against a database for potential metabolite matches. Higher accuracy mass measurement allows the use of a narrower mass tolerance window for mass search. While various types of mass analyzers can routinely measure a peak mass with an error of less than a few ppm, mass measurement accuracy is not uniform for peaks with different intensities, particularly for quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) MS. Herein we present a simple and convenient method to determine the relation between peak intensity and mass error in LC-QTOF-MS-based metabolome analysis, followed by intensity-dependent mass search (IDMS) of a database for metabolite matches. This method is based on running a series of sodium formate mass calibrants, as part of the standard operating procedure (SOP) in LC-MS data acquisition, and then curve-fitting the measured mass errors and peak intensities. We show that, in two different quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) mass analyzers, mass accuracy is generally reduced as peak intensity decreases, which is independent of m/z values in the range commonly used for metabolite detection (e.g., m/z < 1000). We demonstrate the improvement in metabolite matches using IDMS in the analyses of dansyl labeled standards and human urine samples. We have implemented the IDMS method in the freely available MCID database at www.mycompoundid.org, which is composed of 8021 known human endogenous metabolites and their predicted metabolic products (375,809 compounds from one metabolic reaction and 10,583,901 compounds from two reactions).

MedMeta	Database			Medicinal resources contain a vast array of secondary metabolites that play critical roles in disease treatment, health maintenance, and drug discovery. Nevertheless, challenges such as biosynthetic complexity and species-specific variability have long hindered their systematic exploration. Recent advances in omics technologies and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches have opened new avenues via which to decode biosynthetic pathways and discover secondary metabolites using omics-level data. In this study, we present MedMeta, a curated and integrative database that connects secondary metabolites with genomic, biochemical, and pharmacological information across 1035 medicinal species documented in eight authoritative global pharmacopoeias. MedMeta comprises 146 101 predicted active secondary metabolites, 196 356 biosynthetic pathways, and an extensive set of annotated molecular targets. As a proof of principle, we employed MedMeta to investigate three representative Apiaceae species—Pucedanum praeruptorum, Angelica sinensis, and Apium graveolens—demonstrating its ability to uncover species-specific metabolite profiles, validate enzymatic functions, and identify compounds with important therapeutic potential. Overall, MedMeta can provide a powerful and scalable platform for natural product research, supporting both fundamental studies and applied biomedical applications. This database offers an invaluable resource for compound discovery, synthetic biology, geoherbalism studies, and the modern application of traditional medicinal systems.

Metabolome atlas of the aging mouse brain	Database			The mammalian brain relies on neurochemistry to fulfill its functions. Yet, the complexity of the brain metabolome and its changes during diseases or aging remain poorly understood. Here, we generate a metabolome atlas of the aging wildtype mouse brain from 10 anatomical regions spanning from adolescence to old age. We combine data from three assays and structurally annotate 1,547 metabolites. Almost all metabolites significantly differ between brain regions or age groups, but not by sex. A shift in sphingolipid patterns during aging related to myelin remodeling is accompanied by large changes in other metabolic pathways. Functionally related brain regions (brain stem, cerebrum and cerebellum) are also metabolically similar. In cerebrum, metabolic correlations markedly weaken between adolescence and adulthood, whereas at old age, cross-region correlation patterns reflect decreased brain segregation. We show that metabolic changes can be mapped to existing gene and protein brain atlases. The brain metabolome atlas is publicly available (https://mouse.atlas.metabolomics.us/) and serves as a foundation dataset for future metabolomic studies.

MetalinksDB	Database			From the catalytic breakdown of nutrients to signaling, interactions between metabolites and proteins play an essential role in cellular function. An important case is cell–cell communication, where metabolites, secreted into the microenvironment, initiate signaling cascades by binding to intra- or extracellular receptors of neighboring cells. Protein–protein cell–cell communication interactions are routinely predicted from transcriptomic data. However, inferring metabolite-mediated intercellular signaling remains challenging, partially due to the limited size of intercellular prior knowledge resources focused on metabolites. Here, we leverage knowledge-graph infrastructure to integrate generalistic metabolite-protein with curated metabolite-receptor resources to create MetalinksDB. MetalinksDB is an order of magnitude larger than existing metabolite-receptor resources and can be tailored to specific biological contexts, such as diseases, pathways, or tissue/cellular locations. We demonstrate MetalinksDB’s utility in identifying deregulated processes in renal cancer using multi-omics bulk data. Furthermore, we infer metabolite-driven intercellular signaling in acute kidney injury using spatial transcriptomics data. MetalinksDB is a comprehensive and customizable database of intercellular metabolite-protein interactions, accessible via a web interface (https://metalinks.omnipathdb.org/) and programmatically as a knowledge graph (https://github.com/biocypher/metalinks). We anticipate that by enabling diverse analyses tailored to specific biological contexts, MetalinksDB will facilitate the discovery of disease-relevant metabolite-mediated intercellular signaling processes.

MetHoS 	Database			Abstract   Background   Modern mass spectrometry has revolutionized the detection and analysis of metabolites but likewise, let the data skyrocket with repositories for metabolomics data filling up with thousands of datasets. While there are many software tools for the analysis of individual experiments with a few to dozens of chromatograms, we see a demand for a contemporary software solution capable of processing and analyzing hundreds or even thousands of experiments in an integrative manner with standardized workflows.      Results   Here, we introduce MetHoS as an automated web-based software platform for the processing, storage and analysis of great amounts of mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data sets originating from different metabolomics studies. MetHoS is based on Big Data frameworks to enable parallel processing, distributed storage and distributed analysis of even larger data sets across clusters of computers in a highly scalable manner. It has been designed to allow the processing and analysis of any amount of experiments and samples in an integrative manner. In order to demonstrate the capabilities of MetHoS, thousands of experiments were downloaded from the MetaboLights database and used to perform a large-scale processing, storage and statistical analysis in a proof-of-concept study.      Conclusions   MetHoS is suitable for large-scale processing, storage and analysis of metabolomics data aiming at untargeted metabolomic analyses.

MiMeDB	Database			The Human Microbial Metabolome Database (MiMeDB) (https://mimedb.org) is a comprehensive, multi-omic, microbiome resource that connects: (i) microbes to microbial genomes; (ii) microbial genomes to microbial metabolites; (iii) microbial metabolites to the human exposome and (iv) all of these ‘omes’ to human health. MiMeDB was established to consolidate the growing body of data connecting the human microbiome and the chemicals it produces to both health and disease. MiMeDB contains detailed taxonomic, microbiological and body-site location data on most known human microbes (bacteria and fungi). This microbial data is linked to extensive genomic and proteomic sequence data that is closely coupled to colourful interactive chromosomal maps. The database also houses detailed information about all the known metabolites generated by these microbes, their structural, chemical and spectral properties, the reactions and enzymes responsible for these metabolites and the primary exposome sources (food, drug, cosmetic, pollutant, etc.) that ultimately lead to the observed microbial metabolites in humans. Additional, extensively referenced data about the known or presumptive health effects, measured biosample concentrations and human protein targets for these compounds is provided. All of this information is housed in richly annotated, highly interactive, visually pleasing database that has been designed to be easy to search, easy to browse and easy to navigate. Currently MiMeDB contains data on 626 health effects or bioactivities, 1904 microbes, 3112 references, 22 054 reactions, 24 254 metabolites or exposure chemicals, 648 861 MS and NMR spectra, 6.4 million genes and 7.6 billion DNA bases. We believe that MiMeDB represents the kind of integrated, multi-omic or systems biology database that is needed to enable comprehensive multi-omic integration.

MiMeDB 2.0	Database			The Microbial Metabolome Database (MiMeDB) (https://mimedb.org) is a comprehensive, freely accessible resource linking human-associated microbes to the metabolites they produce, along with their connections to human health, disease, and diet. Since the release of MiMeDB 1.0 in 2023, the database has been substantially expanded and redesigned. Major updates include the systematic addition of millions of newly annotated genes and pathways, thousands of new metabolites, significantly expanded pathway and reaction coverage, along with broader representation of eukaryotic gut microbes. MiMeDB 2.0 now contains >12.9 million annotated microbial genes, over 23.1 million microbial pathways, 29 295 metabolites, 21 829 metabolic reactions, 3725 microbial species and strains, and 514 076 new experimental and predicted nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectra of microbial metabolites. New features, such as detailed microbial descriptions, metabolite origin tags, refined search filters, and species-specific reaction queries, have been added to enhance usability. Likewise, redesigned network and genome viewers have been implemented to support more comprehensive, intuitive, and integrated visualization of complex, multi-omic relationships. The significant addition of more metabolite spectral data and improved spectral search capabilities further strengthen metabolite identification and discovery. Together, these improvements make MiMeDB 2.0 one of the most comprehensive and user-friendly platforms for investigating the human microbiome at a molecular level and exploring the roles of microbes and microbial metabolites in human health, diet, and disease.

MSCAT 	Database			The bottleneck for taking full advantage of metabolomics data is often the availability, awareness, and usability of analysis tools. Software tools specifically designed for metabolomics data are being developed at an increasing rate, with hundreds of available tools already in the literature. Many of these tools are open-source and freely available but are very diverse with respect to language, data formats, and stages in the metabolomics pipeline. To help mitigate the challenges of meeting the increasing demand for guidance in choosing analytical tools and coordinating the adoption of best practices for reproducibility, we have designed and built the MSCAT (Metabolomics Software CATalog) database of metabolomics software tools that can be sustainably and continuously updated. This database provides a survey of the landscape of available tools and can assist researchers in their selection of data analysis workflows for metabolomics studies according to their specific needs. We used machine learning (ML) methodology for the purpose of semi-automating the identification of metabolomics software tool names within abstracts. MSCAT searches the literature to find new software tools by implementing a Named Entity Recognition (NER) model based on a neural network model at the sentence level composed of a character-level convolutional neural network (CNN) combined with a bidirectional long-short-term memory (LSTM) layer and a conditional random fields (CRF) layer. The list of potential new tools (and their associated publication) is then forwarded to the database maintainer for the curation of the database entry corresponding to the tool. The end-user interface allows for filtering of tools by multiple characteristics as well as plotting of the aggregate tool data to monitor the metabolomics software landscape.

MSnLib	Database			Untargeted high-resolution mass spectrometry is a key tool in clinical metabolomics, natural product discovery and exposomics, with compound identification remaining the major bottleneck. Currently, the standard workflow applies spectral library matching against tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) fragmentation data. Multi-stage fragmentation (MSn) yields more profound insights into substructures, enabling validation of fragmentation pathways; however, the community lacks open MSn reference data of diverse natural products and other chemicals. Here we describe MSnLib, a machine learning-ready open resource of &gt;2 million spectra in MSn trees of 30,008 unique small molecules, built with a high-throughput data acquisition and processing pipeline in the open-source software mzmine. MSnLib is a large-scale, open MSn spectral library featuring &gt;2.3 million MSn and &gt;357,000 MS2 spectra for 30,008 unique small molecules.

Natural Products Atlas 2.0	Database			Within the natural products field there is an increasing emphasis on the study of compounds from microbial sources. This has been fuelled by interest in the central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions and host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a database of known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper reports the release of a new version of the database which includes a full RESTful application programming interface (API), a new website framework, and an expanded database that includes 8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552. In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from both NP Classifier and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a dashboard for taxonomic origin. The database can be accessed via the new interactive website at https://www.npatlas.org.

NMRlipids Databank	Database			Tools based on artificial intelligence (AI) are currently revolutionising many fields, yet their applications are often limited by the lack of suitable training data in programmatically accessible format. Here we propose an effective solution to make data scattered in various locations and formats accessible for data-driven and machine learning applications using the overlay databank format. To demonstrate the practical relevance of such approach, we present the NMRlipids Databank—a community-driven, open-for-all database featuring programmatic access to quality-evaluated atom-resolution molecular dynamics simulations of cellular membranes. Cellular membrane lipid composition is implicated in diseases and controls major biological functions, but membranes are difficult to study experimentally due to their intrinsic disorder and complex phase behaviour. While MD simulations have been useful in understanding membrane systems, they require significant computational resources and often suffer from inaccuracies in model parameters. Here, we demonstrate how programmable interface for flexible implementation of data-driven and machine learning applications, and rapid access to simulation data through a graphical user interface, unlock possibilities beyond current MD simulation and experimental studies to understand cellular membranes. The proposed overlay databank concept can be further applied to other biomolecules, as well as in other fields where similar barriers hinder the AI revolution.

NPMine	Database			Natural products (NPs) are metabolites of great importance due to their fundamental biological role in performing specialized activities, ranging from basic cellular functions to complex ecological interactions. These metabolites have contributed to innovating fields such as agriculture and medicine due to their optimized biological activities, a consequence of evolution. A key factor in ensuring that isolated NPs are novel is to search scientific literature and compare pre-existing chemical entities with the new isolate. Unfortunately, articles are typically not machine-readable, a problem that hinders efficient searching and increases the chances of unintended rediscovery. In addition, the time required to add new compound discoveries to compound databases hinders computational studies on cell metabolism and Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships (QSAR). Here, we present a modularized tool that uses text mining techniques to retrieve chemical entities and taxonomic mentions present in scientific literature, called NPMINE (Natural Products MINIng). We were able to analyze 55,382 scientific articles from some of the most important applied chemistry journals from Brazil and the world, consistently recovering the expected taxonomic and structural information. This processing resulted in 120,970 unique InChI Keys potentially associated with 21,526 unique species mentioned. Using the PubChem BioAssay database we show how QSAR models can be used to mine active leads. The results indicate that NPMINE not only facilitates natural products cataloging, but also assists in biological source assignment and structure-activity relationships, a time-consuming task, typically performed in low throughput.

PharmMet DB	Database			Drug monitoring is an essential component of precision therapeutics, yet existing data bases to support therapeutic monitoring are limited to data curated from the scientific literature or predicted in silico. We used human liver S9 fraction to generate metabolites from 1114 therapeutic drugs spanning diverse drug classes. Metabolites were analyzed by liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry, annotated through differential analysis of preincubation and postincubation samples, curated by comparison to predicted metabolites from BioTransformer 3.0, and compiled into a human liver pharmaceutical metabolite resource, named “Pharmaceutical Metabolite Data Base (PharmMet DB).” Liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry showed heterogeneity in product generation, with some drugs mostly being converted to predicted metabolites, while others were converted to hundreds of unpredicted products characterized by mass-to-charge ratio and chromatographic retention time. Phase I metabolism was dominant, with 30,752 oxidized drug metabolites. Glucuronidation was dominant for phase II metabolism, with 6311 drug metabolites. Notably, 89% of tested drugs produced at least 1 metabolite that was not predicted on BioTransformer 3.0, and these novel metabolites were most frequently detected for anti-inflammatory, central nervous system and antimicrobial drug classes. PharmMet DB provides experimental metabolite profiles to detect therapeutic drug exposures in human biospecimens without a requirement for prescription history. PharmMet DB usage with human epidemiology will advance pharmacometabolomics to improve understanding of drug efficacy, adverse reactions, and interactions in precision medicine.

plantMASST	Database			Understanding the distribution of hundreds of thousands of plant metabolites across the plant kingdom presents a challenge. To address this, we curated publicly available LC-MS/MS data from 19,075 plant extracts and developed the plantMASST reference database encompassing 246 botanical families, 1,469 genera, and 2,793 species. This taxonomically focused database facilitates the exploration of plant-derived molecules using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectra. This tool will aid in drug discovery, biosynthesis, (chemo)taxonomy, and the evolutionary ecology of herbivore interactions.	plantMASST - Community-driven chemotaxonomic digitization of plants	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.05.13.593988v1	bioRxiv	Gomes, P.

Pyrfume	Database			Advances in theoretical understanding are frequently unlocked by access to large, diverse experimental datasets. Our understanding of olfactory neuroscience and psychophysics remain years behind the other senses, in part because rich datasets linking olfactory stimuli with their corresponding percepts, behaviors, and neural pathways remain scarce. Here we present a concerted effort to unlock and unify dozens of stimulus-linked olfactory datasets across species and modalities under a unified framework called Pyrfume. We present examples of how researchers might use Pyrfume to conduct novel analyses uncovering new principles, introduce trainees to the field, or construct benchmarks for machine olfaction.

Spectraverse	Database			Reference libraries of tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) are widely used for metabolite identification in untargeted metabolomics and to train machine-learning models for metabolite annotation. However, public spectral libraries are scattered across disparate databases and contain spectra that are of low resolution or quality, missing critical metadata, or which have chemically incoherent annotations. Addressing these issues requires extensive preprocessing and considerable expertise in mass spectrometry, which presents a significant barrier to investigators interested in developing their own machine-learning models. Here we present Spectraverse, a comprehensive and extensively curated library of public MS/MS spectra from small molecules. We assembled reference spectra both from major repositories and previously overlooked resources, then developed a preprocessing pipeline to harmonize metadata, standardize chemical structures, and remove low-quality or redundant spectra. These efforts led us to identify previously undocumented pitfalls in existing public libraries that may have confounded prior comparisons of machine-learning models, or conversely have caused valid MS/MS spectra to have been discarded from the training sets of these models. The resulting resource affords the most comprehensive coverage of chemical space of any machine-learning-ready library of MS/MS spectra to date, while also expanding coverage of adducts and ionization modes encountered in metabolomic experiments. We intend to maintain and expand Spectraverse in order to encompass the growing number of publicly available reference MS/MS spectra that can be expected to accumulate in the future.

TOMATOMET	Database			Abstract The total number of low‐molecular‐weight compounds in the plant kingdom, most of which are secondary metabolites, is hypothesized to be over one million, although only a limited number of plant compounds have been characterized. Untargeted analysis, especially using mass spectrometry (MS), has been useful for understanding the plant metabolome; however, due to the limited availability of authentic compounds for MS‐based identification, the identities of most of the ion peaks detected by MS remain unknown. Accurate mass values of peaks obtained by high accuracy mass measurement and, if available, MS/MS fragmentation patterns provide abundant annotation for each peak. Here, we carried out an untargeted analysis of compounds in the mature fruit of 25 tomato cultivars using liquid chromatography‐Orbitrap MS for accurate mass measurement, followed by manual curation to construct the metabolome database TOMATOMET (http://metabolites.in/tomato‐fruits/). The database contains 7,118 peaks with accurate mass values, in which 1,577 ion peaks are annotated as members of a chemical group. Remarkably, 71% of the mass values are not found in the accurate masses detected previously in Arabidopsis thaliana, Medicago truncatula or Jatropha curcas, indicating significant chemical diversity among plant species that remains to be solved. Interestingly, substantial chemical diversity exists also among tomato cultivars, indicating that chemical profiling from distinct cultivars contributes towards understanding the metabolome, even in a single organ of a species, and can prioritize some desirable metabolic targets for further applications such as breeding.

MIBiG 3.0	Database/Biosynthetic Gene Clusters			With an ever-increasing amount of (meta)genomic data being deposited in sequence databases, (meta)genome mining for natural product biosynthetic pathways occupies a critical role in the discovery of novel pharmaceutical drugs, crop protection agents and biomaterials. The genes that encode these pathways are often organised into biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs). In 2015, we defined the Minimum Information about a Biosynthetic Gene cluster (MIBiG): a standardised data format that describes the minimally required information to uniquely characterise a BGC. We simultaneously constructed an accompanying online database of BGCs, which has since been widely used by the community as a reference dataset for BGCs and was expanded to 2021 entries in 2019 (MIBiG 2.0). Here, we describe MIBiG 3.0, a database update comprising large-scale validation and re-annotation of existing entries and 661 new entries. Particular attention was paid to the annotation of compound structures and biological activities, as well as protein domain selectivities. Together, these new features keep the database up-to-date, and will provide new opportunities for the scientific community to use its freely available data, e.g. for the training of new machine learning models to predict sequence-structure-function relationships for diverse natural products. MIBiG 3.0 is accessible online at https://mibig.secondarymetabolites.org/.

MetabFlow	Database/Exposomics			Exogenous natural products (NPs) undergo complex metabolic transformations both in vivo and in vitro, generating structurally diverse metabolites. Due to the involvement of host enzymes and gut microbiota, as well as the structural complexity of NPs themselves, their metabolic processes exhibit unique characteristics. However, existing metabolic transformation information remains fragmented, limiting systematic understanding of their metabolic mechanisms. To address this gap, MetabFlow, a comprehensive database dedicated to the metabolism of exogenous NPs, was developed. MetabFlow is distinguished by: (a) systematic integration of 7294 curated metabolic reactions covering both in vivo and in vitro transformations, providing a complete knowledge map of exogenous NP metabolism; (b) unique integration of enzyme‑catalyzed and microbiota‑mediated reactions, highlighting the distinctive metabolic features of NPs; (c) establishment of a structured metabolic network by constructing upstream‑downstream reaction relationships, elucidating how exogenous NPs evolve across different metabolic pathways; (d) inclusion of approximately 3200 compounds not indexed in mainstream databases, with detailed structural information, annotations, and complete metabolic profiles. MetabFlow is designed to support research in NP metabolism, drug discovery, and related fields.

EASY-FIA	DIMS			Flow injection analysis coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (FIA-HRMS) is a fair trade-off between resolution and speed. However, free software available for data pre-processing is few, web-based, and often requires advanced user specialization. These tools rarely embedded blank and noise evaluation strategies, and direct feature annotation. We developed EASY-FIA, a free standalone application that can be employed for FIA-HRMS metabolomic data pre-processing by users with no bioinformatics/programming skills. We validated the tool′s performance and applicability in two clinical metabolomics case studies. The main functions of our application are blank subtraction, alignment of the metabolites, and direct feature annotation by means of the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) using a minimum number of mass spectrometry parameters. In a scenario where FIA-HRMS is increasingly recognized as a reliable strategy for fast metabolomics analysis, EASY-FIA could become a standardized and feasible tool easily usable by all scientists dealing with MS-based metabolomics. EASY-FIA was implemented in MATLAB with the App Designer tool and it is freely available for download.

rIDIMS	DIMS			Metabolomics using mass spectrometry-only (MS) analysis either by continuous or intermittent direct infusion (DIMS) and ambient ionization techniques (AMS) has grown in popularity due to their rapid, high-throughput nature and the advantage of performing fast analysis with minimal or no sample pretreatments. But currently, end-users without programming knowledge do not find applications with Graphical User Interface (GUI) specialized in processing DIMS or AMS data. Specifically, there is a lack of standardized workflow for processing data from limited sample sizes and scans from different total ion chronograms (TIC).To address this gap, we present rIDIMS, a browser-based application that offers a straightforward and fast workflow focusing on high-quality scan selection, grouping of isotopologues and adducts, data alignment, binning, and filtering. We also introduce a novel function for selecting TIC scans that is reproducible and statistically reliable, which is a feature particularly useful for studies with limited sample sizes. After processing in rIDIMS, the result is exported in an HTML report document that presents publication-quality figures, statistical data and tables, ready to be customized and exported. We demonstrate rIDIMS functionality in three cases: (i) Classification of coffee bean species through the chemical profile obtained with Mass Spec Pen; (ii) Public repository DIMS data from lipid profiling in monogenic insulin resistance syndromes, and (iii) Lipids for lung cancer classification. We show that our implementation facilitates the processing of AMS and DIMS data through an easy and intuitive interface, contributing to reproducible and reliable metabolomic investigations. Indeed, rIDIMS function asa user-friendly GUI based Shiny web application for intuitive use by end-users (available at https://github.com/BioinovarLab/rIDIMS	rIDIMS: A novel tool for processing direct-infusion mass spectrometry data	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0039914024016527?via%3Dihub	Talanta	Mansoldo, F.

Tidy-Direct-to-MS	DIMS			Direct-to-Mass Spectrometry and ambient ionization techniques can be used for biochemical fingerprinting in a fast way. Data processing is typically accomplished with vendor-provided software tools. Here, a novel, open-source functionality, entitled Tidy-Direct-to-MS, was developed for data processing of direct-to-MS data sets. It allows for fast and user-friendly processing using different modules for optional sample position detection and separation, mass-to-charge ratio drift detection and correction, consensus spectra calculation, and bracketing across sample positions as well as feature abundance calculation. The tool also provides functionality for the automated comparison of different sets of parameters, thereby assisting the user in the complex task of finding an optimal combination to maximize the total number of detected features while also checking for the detection of user-provided reference features. In addition, Tidy-Direct-to-MS has the capability for data quality review and subsequent data analysis, thereby simplifying the workflow of untargeted ambient MS-based metabolomics studies. Tidy-Direct-to-MS is implemented in the Python programming language as part of the TidyMS library and can thus be easily extended. Capabilities of Tidy-Direct-to-MS are showcased in a data set acquired in a marine metabolomics study reported in MetaboLights (MTBLS1198) using a transmission mode Direct Analysis in Real Time-Mass Spectrometry (TM-DART-MS)-based method.

BitBIRCH-Lean	Drug Discovery			We present BitBIRCH-Lean, a fast, memory-efficient implementation of the Bit-BIRCH algorithm, designed for high-throughput clustering of huge molecular libraries (up to billions of drug-like molecules) on typical workstations. BitBIRCH-Lean considerably improves on the original BitBIRCH implementation by incorporating dynamic types and bit-packed fingerprints inside the clustering tree. Most operations in BitBIRCH-Lean are efficiently performed on compressed data, and optional C++ extension accelerate the bottleneck calculations, providing up to 2X speedup. Benchmark tests against GPU-accelerated methods highlight BitBIRCH-Lean as an efficient alternative for processing vast amounts of molecules. We further demonstrate the versatility of this new package by showcasing a parallel, multi-round variant of the Bit- BIRCH algorithm that exploits the gains in efficiency to cluster hundreds of millions of molecules in minutes, with no loss in cluster quality.

ChromaQuant	Drug Discovery			Protein complexes are central to cellular function and respond rapidly to pharmacological perturbations. Co-fractionation mass spectrometry (CoFrac-MS) is widely employed to analyze protein complexes by analyzing individual chromatographic fractions, but it is labor-intensive and slow. To address these challenges, we introduce a chromatography-guided strategy enabling rapid identification of drug-perturbed protein complexes. It combines cross-linking enhanced reversed phase liquid chromatography cofractionation (XL-CoFrac) for high-resolution separation with ChromaQuant, a custom tool for precise peak quantification and differential analysis (https://hplcfdu.shinyapps.io/ChromaQuant/). Subsequent targeted MS analyses, guided by ChromaQuant, collectively establish the XL-CoFrac-Q-MS workflow. In proof-of-concept studies, we first adopted XL-CoFrac to MCF7 cells and profiled representative protein complexes. ChromaQuant demonstrated exceptional precision, achieving coefficients of variation below 1% and replicate correlations exceeding 0.98. Furthermore, we analyzed RS4;11 leukemia cells treated with increasing concentrations of the BCL-2 inhibitor ABT-199 using the XL-CoFrac-Q-MS workflow. Seven chromatographic peaks that changed consistently with the drug concentration were selected to be identified by this approach. MS analysis of these peaks revealed cross-linked peptides from the BCL-2 associated protein complex. Specially, cross-linking peptides between BCL-2 and FKBP38 may shed light on the mechanisms underlying resistance to ABT-199. Further pathway enrichment analysis provides new insights into the molecular mechanisms driving ABT-199 induced apoptosis. Collectively, the XL-CoFrac-Q-MS strategy holds significant potential for broad applications, including rapid screening of drug targets and elucidation of protein complex dynamics across various pharmacological and pathological conditions.		https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c02702	Analytical Chemistry	Liu, Wei, Tang, Jiayu, Yan, Guoquan, Shen, Shun, Gao, Mingxia, & Zhang, Xiangmin (2025).

DMetFinder	Drug Discovery			The study of drug metabolites is essential for evaluating safety and optimizing drug design. Recent classes of high-molecular-weight drugs, such as PROTACs and LYTACs, present challenges for traditional metabolite identification approaches due to their complex structures. To address these limitations, we developed Drug Metabolite Finder (DMetFinder), a novel mass spectrometry-based tool designed to enhance metabolite identification. DMetFinder employs cosine similarity algorithms to filter compounds with similar structures, minimizing the risk of overlooking metabolites with large fragment losses. It also efficiently detects multiply charged ions and incorporates isotope abundance and adduct ion scoring to refine identification accuracy. By calculating a total weighted score, DMetFinder reduces false positives associated with single-filter strategies. Experimental validation demonstrates that DMetFinder significantly improves the identification of metabolites from PROTACs, providing valuable insights for future drug development.

Limelight 	Drug Discovery			Drugs are often metabolized to reactive intermediates that form protein adducts. Adducts can inhibit protein activity, elicit immune responses, and cause life-threatening adverse drug reactions. The masses of reactive metabolites are frequently unknown, rendering traditional mass spectrometry-based proteomics approaches incapable of adduct identification. Here, we present Magnum, an open-mass search algorithm optimized for adduct identification, and Limelight, a web-based data processing package for analysis and visualization of data from all existing algorithms. Limelight incorporates tools for sample comparisons and xenobiotic-adduct discovery. We validate our tools with three drug/protein combinations and apply our label-free workflow to identify novel xenobiotic-protein adducts in CYP3A4. Our new methods and software enable accurate identification of xenobiotic-protein adducts with no prior knowledge of adduct masses or protein targets. Magnum outperforms existing label-free tools in xenobiotic-protein adduct discovery, while Limelight fulfills a major need in the rapidly developing field of open-mass searching, which until now lacked comprehensive data visualization tools.

SynFrag	Drug Discovery		Yes	AI-driven molecular generation encounters a "generation-synthesis gap": most computationally designed molecules cannot be synthesized in laboratories, limiting AI-assisted drug design (AIDD) applications. Current approaches to assess synthetic accessibility (SA) include computer-aided synthesis planning (CASP) tools that perform retrosynthetic searches, and machine learning-based SA prediction models that provide rapid scoring. CASP tools are computationally expensive for high-throughput screening, while existing SA prediction models may lack chemical synthesis logic or exhibit variable performance across different chemical spaces. We developed SynFrag, an SA prediction model using fragment assembly autoregressive generation to learn stepwise molecular construction patterns. Self-supervised pretraining on millions of unlabeled molecules enables learning of dynamic fragment assembly patterns beyond fragment occurrence statistics or reaction step annotations. This approach captures connectivity relationships relevant to synthesis difficulty cliffs, where minor structural changes substantially alter SA. Evaluation across public benchmarks, clinical drugs with intermediates, and AI-generated molecules shows consistent performance across diverse chemical spaces. The model produces sub-second predictions with attention mechanisms corresponding to key reactive sites. SynFrag provides computational efficiency suitable for large-scale screening while maintaining interpretability for detailed SA assessment in drug discovery workflows.

MSThunder	Exposomics		Yes	Nontargeted analysis (NTA) has emerged as a crucial technology for identifying unknown organic pollutants in water. However, current NTA methods commonly omit or misjudge the pollutants due to the low-accuracy and efficiency in the structural prediction of mass spectrometry. Here, we developed a novel NTA framework named MSThunder for rapid and accurate identification of unknown organic pollutants in water. We first constructed a method for obtaining product ion formulas with isotopes to expand additional features into the input while mitigating noise interference from the matrix. Then, we established a transformer model that transitions from formulas to structural sequences, less constrained by the lack of training data. MSThunder achieved 59.1 % top-1 accuracy in the benchmark (CASMI 2016 Challenge), outperforming other major existing models. The highest 77.1 % of chemical structures across all real-world experimental samples spiked with a trace mixture of 96 pollutants were correctly inferred, superior to both SIRIUS (74.0 %) and TraceFinder (46.9 %). The highest prediction speed of 0.32 s per spectrum was achieved among existing models. Furthermore, 181 pollutants were identified in various water samples of Yellow River Basin by MSThunder. Three pollutants with high potential hazards, including triallyl cyanurate, harmaline and 5,7-dimethyl-3-methylsulfonyl-[1,2]thiazolo[3,4-d]pyrimidine-4,6-dione, were first found in the water samples. This will promote the screening of unknown hazardous organic pollutants in water and provide the fundamental methods for water quality safety assessment.

CMDN	Exposomics			The human exposome features a highly expansive chemical space and substantial individual variability. Although screenings of xenobiotic compounds have revealed exposure landscapes of specific compounds, significant bottlenecks remain in profiling their biotransformed products for comprehensive exposome-wide analysis, including limitations to known metabolites, challenges in new metabolite annotation, and low throughput. In this study, we developed an untargeted metabolomics-based compound metabolite discovery network (CMDN) to facilitate high-throughput annotation of xenobiotic metabolites. CMDN integrates a triple-layered architecture comprising a differential expression metabolic space, a rule-based pseudo-MS1 candidature space and an MS2 spectrum similarity network. The utilities and advantages are demonstrated using pesticides as a representative example, given their widespread human exposure and well-documented toxicity. Coupled with enzymatic biotransformation assays involving 1,021 pesticides, CMDN nonredundantly annotated 2,886 biotransformed derivatives. Following multichannel validation, including standard verification, retention time prediction, murine studies, and time-course logistic modeling, identified metabolites were screened in a human cohort, revealing a novel, diverse, and extensive exposure spectrum. Collectively, this study establishes, for the first time, a scalable workflow for the annotation and screening of previously undercharacterized xenobiotic metabolites with unprecedented throughput, representing a significant advancement toward the characterization, interpretation, and prioritization of the human exposome.

EISA-EXPOSOME	Exposomics			Lacking a highly sensitive exposome screening technique is one of the biggest challenges in moving exposomic research forward. Enhanced in-source fragmentation/annotation (EISA) has been developed to facilitate molecular identification in untargeted metabolomics and proteomics. In this work, with a mixture of 50 pesticides at three concentration levels (20, 4, and 0.8 ppb), we investigated the analytical performance of the EISA technique over the well-accepted targeted MS/MS mode (TMM) in the detection and identification of chemicals at low levels using a quadrupole time-of-flight (qTOF) instrument. Compared with the TMM method, the EISA technique can recognize additional 1, 20, and 23 chemicals, respectively, at the three concentration levels (20, 4, and 0.8 ppb, respectively) investigated. At the 0.8 ppb level, intensities of precursor ions and fragments observed using the EISA technique are 30–1,154 and 3–80 times higher, respectively, than those observed at the TMM mode. A higher matched fragment ratio (MFR) between the EISA technique and the TMM method was recognized for most chemicals. We further developed a chemical annotation informatics algorithm, EISA-EXPOSOME, which can automatically search each precursor ion (m/z) in the MS/MS library against the EISA MS1 spectra. This algorithm then calculated a weighted score to rank the candidate features by comparing the experimental fragment spectra to those in the library. The peak intensity, zigzag index, and retention time prediction model as well as the peak correlation coefficient were further adopted in the algorithm to filter false positives. The performance of EISA-EXPOSOME was demonstrated using a pooled dust extract with a pesticide mixture (n = 200) spiked at 5 ppb. One urine sample spiked with a contaminant mixture (n = 50) at the 5 ppb level was also used for the validation of the pipeline. Proof-of-principal application of EISA-EXPOSOME in the real sample was further evaluated on the pooled dust sample with a modified T3DB database (n = 1650). Our results show that the EISA-EXPOSOME algorithm can remarkably improve the detection and annotation coverage at trace levels beyond the traditional approach as well as facilitate the high throughput screening of suspected chemicals.

ExposomeX	Exposomics			Exposome has become the hotspot of next-generation health studies. To date, there is no available effective platform to standardize the analysis of exposomic data. In this study, we aim to propose one new framework of exposomic analysis and build up one novel integrated platform “ExposomeX” to expediate the discovery of the “Exposure-Biology-Disease” nexus. We have developed 13 standardized modules to accomplish six major functions including statistical learning (E-STAT), exposome database search (E-DB), mass spectrometry data processing (E-MS), meta-analysis (E-META), biological link via pathway integration and protein-protein interaction (E-BIO) and data visualization (E-VIZ). Using ExposomeX, we can effectively analyze the multiple-dimensional exposomics data and investigate the “Exposure-Biology-Disease” nexus by exploring mediation and interaction effects, understanding statistical and biological mechanisms, strengthening prediction performance, and automatically conducting meta-analysis based on well-established literature databases. The performance of ExposomeX has been well validated by re-analyzing two previous multi-omics studies. Additionally, ExposomeX can efficiently help discover new associations, as well as relevant in-depth biological pathways via protein-protein interaction and gene ontology network analysis. In sum, we have proposed a novel framework for standardized exposomic analysis, which can be accessed using both R and online interactive platform (http://www.exposomex.cn/).

FeatureHunter	Exposomics			Exposure to the physicochemical agents that interact with nucleic acids (NA) may lead to modification of DNA and RNA (i.e., NA modifications), which have been associated with various diseases, including cancer. The emerging field of NA adductomics aims to identify both known and unknown NA modifications, some of which may also be associated with proteins. One of the main challenges for adductomics is the processing of massive and complex data generated by high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HR-MS/MS). To address this, we have developed a software called “FeatureHunter”, which provides the automated extraction, annotation, and classification of different types of key NA modifications based on the MS and MS/MS spectra acquired by HR-MS/MS, using a user-defined feature list. The capability and effectiveness of FeatureHunter was demonstrated by analyzing various NA modifications induced by formaldehyde or chlorambucil in mixtures of calf thymus DNA, yeast RNA and proteins, and by analyzing the NA modifications present in the pooled urines of smokers and nonsmokers. The incorporation of FeatureHunter into the NA adductomics workflow offers a powerful tool for the identification and classification of various types of NA modifications induced by reactive chemicals in complex biological samples, providing a valuable resource for studying the exposome.

FluoroMatch IM	Exposomics			Abstract There are thousands of different per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) in everyday products and in the environment. Discerning the abundance and diversity of PFAS is essential for understanding sources, fate, exposure routes, and the associated health impacts of PFAS. While comprehensive detection of PFAS requires the use of nontargeted mass spectrometry, data processing is time intensive and prone to error. While automated approaches can compile all mass spectrometric evidence (e.g., retention time, isotopic pattern, fragmentation, and accurate mass) and provide ranking or scoring metrics for annotations, confident assignment of structure often still requires extensive manual review of the data. To aid this process, we present FluoroMatch Visualizer, an open-source free software which was developed to provide interactive visualizations which include normalized mass defect plots, retention time versus accurate mass plots, MS/MS fragmentation spectra, and tables of annotations and metadata. All graphs and tables are interactive and have cross-filtering such that when a user selects a feature, all other visuals highlight the feature of interest. Several filtering options have been integrated into this novel data visualization tool, specifically with the capability to filter by PFAS chemical series, fragment(s), assignment confidence, and MS/MS file(s). FluoroMatch Visualizer is part of FluoroMatch Suite, which consists of FluoroMatch Modular, FluoroMatch Flow, and FluoroMatch Generator. FluoroMatch Visualizer enables annotations to be extensively validated, increasing annotation confidence. The resulting visualizations and datasets can be shared online in an interactive format for community-based PFAS discovery. FluoroMatch visualizer holds potential to promote harmonization of nontargeted data processing and interpretation throughout the PFAS scientific community.

HalogenFinder	Exposomics			Over 70% of organic halogens, representing chlorine- and bromine-containing disinfection byproducts (Cl-/Br-DBPs), remain unidentified after 50 years of research. This work introduces a streamlined and cloud-based exposomics workflow that integrates high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) analysis, multistage machine learning, and cloud computing for efficient analysis and characterization of Cl-/Br-DBPs. In particular, the multistage machine learning structure employs progressively different heavy isotopic peaks at each layer and capture the distinct isotopic characteristics of nonhalogenated compounds and Cl-/Br-compounds at different halogenation levels. This innovative approach enables the recognition of 22 types of Cl-/Br-compounds with up to 6 Br and 8 Cl atoms. To address the data imbalance among different classes, particularly the limited number of heavily chlorinated and brominated compounds, data perturbation is performed to generate hypothetical/synthetic molecular formulas containing multiple Cl and Br atoms, facilitating data augmentation. To further benefit the environmental chemistry community with limited computational experience and hardware access, above innovations are incorporated into HalogenFinder (http://www.halogenfinder.com/), a user-friendly, web-based platform for Cl-/Br-compound characterization, with statistical analysis support via MetaboAnalyst. In the benchmarking, HalogenFinder outperformed two established tools, achieving a higher recognition rate for 277 authentic Cl-/Br-compounds and uniquely identifying the number of Cl/Br atoms. In laboratory tests of DBP mixtures, it identified 72 Cl-/Br-DBPs with proposed structures, of which eight were confirmed with chemical standards. A retrospective analysis of 2022 finished water HRMS data revealed insightful temporal trends in Cl-DBP features. These results demonstrate HalogenFinder’s effectiveness in advancing Cl-/Br-compound identification for environmental science and exposomics.

HExpMetDB	Exposomics			Background: Due to the ubiquitous use of chemicals in modern society, humans are increasingly exposed to thousands of chemicals that contribute to a major portion of the human exposome. Should a comprehensive and risk-based human exposome database be created, it would be conducive to the rapid progress of human exposomics research. In addition, once a xenobiotic is biotransformed with distinct half-lives upon exposure, monitoring the parent compounds alone may not reflect the actual human exposure. To address these questions, a comprehensive and risk-prioritized human exposome database is needed. Objectives: Our objective was to set up a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database including physicochemical properties as well as risk prediction and develop a graphical user interface (GUI) that has the ability to conduct searches for content associated with chemicals in our database. Methods: We built a comprehensive risk-prioritized human exposome database by text mining and database fusion. Subsequently, chemicals were prioritized by integrating exposure level obtained from the Systematic Empirical Evaluation of Models with toxicity data predicted by the Toxicity Estimation Software Tool and the Toxicological Priority Index calculated from the ToxCast database. The biotransformation half-lives (HLB⁢s) of all the chemicals were assessed using the Iterative Fragment Selection approach and biotransformation products were predicted using the previously developed BioTransformer machine-learning method. Results: We compiled a human exposome database of >20,000 chemicals, prioritized 13,441 chemicals based on probabilistic hazard quotient and 7,770 chemicals based on risk index, and provided a predicted biotransformation metabolite database of >95,000 metabolites. In addition, a user-interactive Java software (Oracle)-based search GUI was generated to enable open access to this new resource. Discussion: Our database can be used to guide chemical management and enhance scientific understanding to rapidly and effectively prioritize chemicals for comprehensive biomonitoring in epidemiological investigations.

MDRB	Exposomics			Background: Deciphering the in vivo processes of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is crucial for identifying new pharmacodynamic substances and new drugs. Due to the complexity and diversity of components, investigating the exposure, metabolism, and disposition remains a major challenge in TCM research. In recent years, a number of non-targeted smart mass-spectrometry (MS) techniques, such as precise-and-thorough background-subtraction (PATBS) and metabolomics, have realized the intelligent identification of in vivo components of TCM. However, the metabolites characterization still largely relies on manual identification in combination with online databases.  Results: We developed a scoring approach based on the structural similarity and minimal mass defect variations between metabolites and prototypes. The current method integrates three dimensions of mass spectral data including m/z, mass defect of MS1 and MS2, and the similarity of MS2 fragments, which was sequentially analyzed by a R-based mass dataset relevance bridging (MDRB) data post-processing technique. The MDRB technology constructed a component relationship network for TCM, significantly improving metabolite identification efficiency and facilitating the mapping of translational metabolic pathways. By combining MDRB with PATBS through this non-targeted identification technology, we developed a comprehensive strategy for identification, characterization and bridging analysis of TCM metabolite in vivo. As a proof of concept, we adopted the proposed strategy to investigate the process of exposure, metabolism, and disposition of Semen Armeniacae Amarum (CKXR) in mice.  Significance: The currently proposed analytical approach is universally applicable and demonstrates its effectiveness in analyzing complex components of TCMs in vitro and in vivo. Furthermore, it enables the correlation of in vitro and in vivo data, providing insights into the metabolic transformations among components sharing the same parent nucleus structure. Finally, the developed MDRB platform is publicly available for ( https://github.com/933ZhangDD/MDRB ) for accelerating TCM research for the scientific community.

pyAIR	Exposomics			Volatile metabolites in exhaled air have promising potential as diagnostic biomarkers. However, the combination of low mass, similar chemical composition, and low concentrations introduces the challenge of sorting the data to identify markers of value. In this paper, we report the development of pyAIR, a software tool for searching for volatile organic compounds (VOCs) markers in multi-group datasets, tailored for Thermal-Desorption Gas-Chromatography High Resolution Mass-Spectrometry (TD-GC-HRMS) output. pyAIR aligns the compounds between samples by spectral similarity coupled with retention times (RT), and statistically compares the groups for compounds that differ by intensity. This workflow was successfully tested and evaluated on gaseous samples spiked with 27 model VOCs at six concentrations, divided into three groups, down to 0.3 nL/L. All analytes were correctly detected and aligned. More than 80% were found to be significant markers with a p-value < 0.05; several were classified as possibly significant markers (p-value < 0.1), while a few were removed due to background level. In all group comparisons, low rates of false markers were found. These results showed the potential of pyAIR in the field of trace-level breathomics, with the capability to differentially examine several groups, such as stages of illness. 	pyAIR: an open‑source tool for breathomics data analysis	https://www.mdpi.com/1420-3049/27/7/2063	Molecules	Aviram, L.

Aird	Formats			Background With the precision of the mass spectrometry (MS) going higher, the MS file size increases rapidly. Beyond the widely-used open format mzML, near-lossless or lossless compression algorithms and formats emerged in scenarios with different precision requirements. The data precision is often related to the instrument and subsequent processing algorithms. Unlike storage-oriented formats, which focus more on lossless compression rate, computation-oriented formats concentrate as much on decoding speed as the compression rate. Results  Here we introduce “Aird”, an opensource and computation-oriented format with controllable precision, flexible indexing strategies, and high compression rate. Aird provides a novel compressor called Zlib-Diff-PforDelta (ZDPD) for m/z data. Compared with Zlib only, m/z data size is about 55% lower in Aird average. With the high-speed decoding and encoding performance of the single instruction multiple data technology used in the ZDPD, Aird merely takes 33% decoding time compared with Zlib. We have downloaded seven datasets from ProteomeXchange and Metabolights. They are from different SCIEX, Thermo, and Agilent instruments. Then we convert the raw data into mzML, mgf, and mz5 file formats by MSConvert and compare them with Aird format. Aird uses JavaScript Object Notation for metadata storage. Aird-SDK is written in Java, and AirdPro is a GUI client for vendor file converting written in C#. They are freely available at https://github.com/CSi-Studio/Aird-SDK and https://github.com/CSi-Studio/AirdPro. Conclusions  With the innovation of MS acquisition mode, MS data characteristics are also constantly changing. New data features can bring more effective compression methods and new index modes to achieve high search performance. The MS data storage mode will also become professional and customized. ZDPD uses multiple MS digital features, and researchers also can use it in other formats like mzML. Aird is designed to become a computing-oriented data format with high scalability, compression rate, and fast decoding speed.

AlphaTims	Formats			High-resolution MS-based proteomics generates large amounts of data, even in the standard LC–tandem MS configuration. Adding an ion mobility dimension vastly increases the acquired data volume, challenging both analytical processing pipelines and especially data exploration by scientists. This has necessitated data aggregation, effectively discarding much of the information present in these rich datasets. Taking trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) on a quadrupole TOF (Q-TOF) platform as an example, we developed an efficient indexing scheme that represents all data points as detector arrival times on scales of minutes (LC), milliseconds (TIMS), and microseconds (TOF). In our open-source AlphaTims package, data are indexed, accessed, and visualized by a combination of tools of the scientific Python ecosystem. We interpret unprocessed data as a sparse four-dimensional matrix and use just-in-time compilation to machine code with Numba, accelerating our computational procedures by several orders of magnitude while keeping to familiar indexing and slicing notations. For samples with more than six billion detector events, a modern laptop can load and index raw data in about a minute. Loading is even faster when AlphaTims has already saved indexed data in an HDF5 file, a portable scientific standard used in extremely large-scale data acquisition. Subsequently, data accession along any dimension and interactive visualization happens in milliseconds. We have found AlphaTims to be a key enabling tool to explore high-dimensional LC-TIMS-Q-TOF data and have made it freely available as an open-source Python package with a stand-alone graphical user interface at https://github.com/MannLabs/alphatims or as part of the AlphaPept ‘ecosystem’.

CloMet	Formats			The field of metabolomics has witnessed the development of hundreds of computational tools, but only a few have become cornerstones of this field. While MetaboLights and Metabolomics Workbench are two well-established data repositories for metabolomics data sets, Workflows4Metabolomics and MetaboAnalyst are two well-established web-based data analysis platforms for metabolomics. Yet, the raw data stored in the aforementioned repositories lack standardization in terms of the file system format used to store the associated acquisition files. Consequently, it is not straightforward to reuse available data sets as input data in the above-mentioned data analysis resources, especially for non-expert users. This paper presents CloMet, a novel open-source modular software platform that contributes to standardization, reusability, and reproducibility in the metabolomics field. CloMet, which is available through a Docker file, converts raw and NMR-based metabolomics data from MetaboLights and Metabolomics Workbench to a file format that can be used directly either in MetaboAnalyst or in Workflows4Metabolomics. We validated both CloMet and the output data using data sets from these repositories. Overall, CloMet fills the gap between well-established data repositories and web-based statistical platforms and contributes to the consolidation of a data-driven perspective of the metabolomics field by leveraging and connecting existing data and resources.

Dear-OMG	Formats			As high-throughput omics technologies continue to advance, researchers are facing the challenge of a rapid surge in proteomics, metabolomics, and genomics data. This growth not only necessitates more disk space and network bandwidth, but also complicates data sharing and subsequent analysis. To address this challenge and enhance the analytical efficiency of downstream software, we propose Dear-OMG, a unified, compact, flexible, and high-performance metadata storage solution. Dear-OMG introduces a novel file storage structure and utilizes the Elias-Fano encoding algorithm to compress and store proteomics, genomics, and metabolomics metadata into the unified OMG format. The OMG format not only demonstrates remarkably high compression and decompression speeds, but also enables parallel random access to any data block. Test results reveal that, compared to the commonly used proteomics formats of mzXML and mzML, the OMG format achieves an 80% reduction in storage space, a 90% decrease in conversion time, and approximately a tenfold speed improvement with support for parallel random access.

mspack	Formats			Motivation Mass spectrometry (MS) data, used for proteomics and metabolomics analyses, have seen considerable growth in the last years. Aiming at reducing the associated storage costs, dedicated compression algorithms for MS data have been proposed, such as MassComp and MSNumpress. However, these algorithms focus on either lossless or lossy compression, respectively, and do not exploit the additional redundancy existing across scans contained in a single file. We introduce mspack, a compression algorithm for MS data that exploits this additional redundancy and that supports both lossless and lossy compression, as well as the mzML and the legacy mzXML formats. mspack applies several preprocessing lossless transforms and optional lossy transforms with a configurable error, followed by the general purpose compressors gzip or bsc to achieve a higher compression ratio. Results  We tested mspack on several datasets generated by commonly used MS instruments. When used with the bsc compression backend, mspack achieves on average 76% smaller file sizes for lossless compression and 94% smaller file sizes for lossy compression, as compared with the original files. Lossless mspack achieves 10–60% lower file sizes than MassComp, and lossy mspack compresses 36–60% better than the lossy MSNumpress, for the same error, while exhibiting comparable accuracy and running time.

mwtab Python Library for RESTful Access	Formats			The Metabolomics Workbench (MW) is a public scientific data repository consisting of experimental data and metadata from metabolomics studies collected with mass spectroscopy (MS) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analyses. MW has been constantly evolving; updating its ‘mwTab’ text file format, adding a JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) file format, implementing a REpresentational State Transfer (REST) interface, and nearly quadrupling the number of datasets hosted on the repository within the last three years. In order to keep up with the quickly evolving state of the MW repository, the ‘mwtab’ Python library and package have been continuously updated to mirror the changes in the ‘mwTab’ and JSONized formats and contain many new enhancements including methods for interacting with the MW REST interface, enhanced format validation features, and advanced features for parsing and searching for specific metabolite data and metadata. We used the enhanced format validation features to evaluate all available datasets in MW to facilitate improved curation and FAIRness of the repository. The ‘mwtab’ Python package is now officially released as version 1.0.1 and is freely available on GitHub and the Python Package Index (PyPI) under a Clear Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD) license with documentation available on ReadTheDocs.

MZA	Formats			Modern mass spectrometry-based workflows employing hybrid instrumentation and orthogonal separations collect multidimensional data, potentially allowing deeper understanding in omics studies through adoption of artificial intelligence methods. However, the large volume of these rich spectra challenges existing data storage and access technologies, therefore precluding informatics advancements. We present MZA (pronounced m-za), the mass-to-charge (m/z) generic data storage and access tool designed to facilitate software development and artificial intelligence research in multidimensional mass spectrometry measurements. Composed of a data conversion tool and a simple file structure based on the HDF5 format, MZA provides easy, cross-platform and cross-programming language access to raw MS-data, enabling fast development of new tools in data science programming languages such as Python and R. The software executable, example MS-data and example Python and R scripts are freely available at https://github.com/PNNL-m-q/mza.

mzapy	Formats			Analysis of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) data has been challenging and limited the full utility of these measurements. Unlike liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry, where a plethora of tools with well-established algorithms exist, the incorporation of the additional IMS dimension requires upgrading existing computational pipelines and developing new algorithms to fully exploit the advantages of the technology. We have recently reported MZA, a new and simple mass spectrometry data structure based on the broadly supported HDF5 format and created to facilitate software development. While this format is inherently supportive of application development, the availability of core libraries in popular programming languages with standard mass spectrometry utilities will facilitate fast software development and broader adoption of the format. To this end, we present a Python package, mzapy, for efficient extraction and processing of mass spectrometry data in the MZA format, especially for complex data containing ion mobility spectrometry dimension. In addition to raw data extraction, mzapy contains supporting utilities enabling tasks including calibration, signal processing, peak finding, and generating plots. Being implemented in pure Python and having minimal and largely standardized dependencies makes mzapy uniquely suited to application development in the multiomics domain. The mzapy package is free and open-source, includes comprehensive documentation, and is structured to support future extension to meet the evolving needs of the MS community. The software source code is freely available at https://github.com/PNNL-m-q/mzapy.	mzapy: An Open-Source Python Library Enabling Efficient Extraction and Processing of Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry Data in the MZA File Format 	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.3c01653	Analytical Chemistry	Ross, Dylan, Bilbao, Aivett, Lee, Joon-Yong, & Zheng, Xueyun (2023). <i>mzapy</i>: An Open-Source Python Library Enabling Efficient Extraction and Processing of Ion Mobility Spectrometry-Mass Spectrometry Data in the MZA File Format.

mzPeak	Formats			Advances in mass spectrometry (MS) instrumentation, including higher resolution, faster scan speeds, and improved sensitivity, have dramatically increased the data volume and complexity. The adoption of imaging and ion mobility further amplifies these challenges in proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. Current open formats such as mzML and imzML struggle to keep pace due to large file sizes, slow data access, and limited metadata support. Vendor-specific formats offer faster access but lack interoperability and long-term archival guarantees. We here lay the groundwork for mzPeak, a next-generation community data format designed to address these challenges and support high-throughput, multidimensional MS workflows. By adopting a hybrid model that combines efficient binary storage for numerical data and both human- and machine-readable metadata storage, mzPeak will reduce file sizes, accelerate data access, and offer a scalable, adaptable solution for evolving MS technologies. For researchers, mzPeak will support complex workflows and regulatory compliance through faster access, improved metadata, and interoperability. For vendors, it offers a streamlined, open alternative to proprietary formats. mzPeak aims to become a cornerstone of MS data management, enabling sustainable, high-performance solutions for future data types and fostering collaboration across the mass spectrometry community.	mzPeak: Designing a Scalable, Interoperable, and Future-Ready Mass Spectrometry Data Format	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5c00435	Journal of Proteome Research	Van Den Bossche, T., Alexandrov, T., Bilbao, A., Bittremieux, W., Brigante, F.

pyOpenMS-viz	Formats			Mass spectrometry data visualization is essential for a wide range of applications, such as validation of workflows and results, benchmarking new algorithms, and creating comprehensive quality control reports. Python offers a popular and powerful framework for analyzing and visualizing multidimensional data; however, generating commonly used mass spectrometry plots in Python can be cumbersome. Here we present pyOpenMS-viz, a versatile, unified framework for generating mass spectrometry plots. pyOpenMS-viz directly extends pandas DataFrame plotting for generating figures in a single line of code. This implementation enables easy integration across various Python-based mass spectrometry tools that already use pandas DataFrames to store MS data. pyOpenMS-viz is open-source under a BSD 3-Clause license and freely available at https://github.com/OpenMS/pyopenms_viz.	pyOpenMS-viz: Streamlining Mass Spectrometry Data Visualization with pandas	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.4c00873?ref=recommended	Journal of Proteome Research	Sing, Justin Cyril, Charkow, Joshua, Walter, Axel, Gao, Mingxuan, Müller, Tom David, Bittremieux, Wout, Sachsenberg, Timo, & Röst, Hannes Luc (2025). pyOpenMS-viz: Streamlining Mass Spectrometry Data Visualization with pandas.

rawrr R	Formats			The Bioconductor project (Nat. Methods2015, 12 (2), 115–121) has shown that the R statistical environment is a highly valuable tool for genomics data analysis, but with respect to proteomics, we are still missing low-level infrastructure to enable performant and robust analysis workflows in R. Fundamentally important are libraries that provide raw data access. Our R package rawDiag (J. Proteome Res.2018, 17 (8), 2908–2914) has provided the proof-of-principle how access to mass spectrometry raw files can be realized by wrapping a vendor-provided advanced programming interface (API) for the purpose of metadata analysis and visualization. Our novel package rawrr now provides complete, OS-independent access to all spectral data logged in Thermo Fisher Scientific raw files. In this technical note, we present implementation details and describe the main functionalities provided by the rawrr package. In addition, we report two use cases inspired by real-world research tasks that demonstrate the application of the package. The raw data used for demonstration purposes was deposited as MassIVE data set MSV000086542. Availability: https://github.com/fgcz/rawrr.

SpectriPy	Formats			Mass spectrometry (MS) is a key technology used across multiple fields, including biomed- ical research and life sciences. The data is often times large and complex, and analyses must be tailored to the experimental and instrumental setups. Excellent software libraries for such data analysis are available in both R and Python, including R packages from the RforMassSpectrometry initiative such as Spectra, MsCoreUtils, MetaboAnnotation, and Com- poundDb (Rainer et al., 2022), as well as Python libraries like matchms (Huber et al., 2020), spectrum_utils (Bittremieux, 2020), Pyteomics (Goloborodko et al., 2013), and pyOpenMS (Röst et al., 2014). The reticulate R package (Ushey et al., 2025) provides an R interface to Python enabling interoperability between the two programming languages. The open-source SpectriPy R package builds upon reticulate and provides functionality to efficiently translate between R and Python MS data structures. It can convert between R’s Spectra::Spectra and Python’s matchms.Spectrum and spectrum_utils.spectrum.MsmsSpectrum objects and includes functionality to directly apply spectral similarity, filtering, normalization, etc. routines from the Python matchms library on MS data in R. SpectriPy hence enables and simplifies the integration of R and Python for MS data analysis, empowering data analysts to benefit from the full power of algorithms in both programming languages. Furthermore, software developers can reuse algorithms across languages rather than re-implementing them, enhancing efficiency and collaboration 	SpectriPy: Enhancing Cross-Language Mass Spectrometry Data Analysis with R and Python	https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.08070	The Journal of Open Source Software	De Graeve, M., Bittremieux, W., Naake, T., Huber, C., Anagho-Mattanovich, M., Hoffmann, N., ... & Rainer, J.

MetaboDirect	FT-ICR MS			Abstract Background   Microbiomes are now recognized as the main drivers of ecosystem function ranging from the oceans and soils to humans and bioreactors. However, a grand challenge in microbiome science is to characterize and quantify the chemical currencies of organic matter (i.e., metabolites) that microbes respond to and alter. Critical to this has been the development of Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS), which has drastically increased molecular characterization of complex organic matter samples, but challenges users with hundreds of millions of data points where readily available, user-friendly, and customizable software tools are lacking.      Results   Here, we build on years of analytical experience with diverse sample types to develop MetaboDirect, an open-source, command-line-based pipeline for the analysis (e.g., chemodiversity analysis, multivariate statistics), visualization (e.g., Van Krevelen diagrams, elemental and molecular class composition plots), and presentation of direct injection high-resolution FT-ICR MS data sets after molecular formula assignment has been performed. When compared to other available FT-ICR MS software, MetaboDirect is superior in that it requires a single line of code to launch a fully automated framework for the generation and visualization of a wide range of plots, with minimal coding experience required. Among the tools evaluated, MetaboDirect is also uniquely able to automatically generate biochemical transformation networks (ab initio) based on mass differences (mass difference network-based approach) that provide an experimental assessment of metabolite connections within a given sample or a complex metabolic system, thereby providing important information about the nature of the samples and the set of microbial reactions or pathways that gave rise to them. Finally, for more experienced users, MetaboDirect allows users to customize plots, outputs, and analyses.      Conclusion   Application of MetaboDirect to FT-ICR MS-based metabolomic data sets from a marine phage-bacterial infection experiment and a Sphagnum leachate microbiome incubation experiment showcase the exploration capabilities of the pipeline that will enable the research community to evaluate and interpret their data in greater depth and in less time. It will further advance our knowledge of how microbial communities influence and are influenced by the chemical makeup of the surrounding system. The source code and User’s guide of MetaboDirect are freely available through (https://github.com/Coayala/MetaboDirect) and (https://metabodirect.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), respectively.

MoleTrans	FT-ICR MS			Dissolved fractions of organic matter in natural and anthropogenic sources, also known as dissolved organic matter (DOM), play crucial roles in natural and engineering processes. Application of the Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometer (FT-ICR MS) has expanded dramatically for the molecular characterization of DOM in various research communities. However, data processing/mining on the detected tens of thousands of molecular formulas is complex. Here, we introduced a browser-based webtool (MoleTrans) for flexible and comprehensive postanalysis on a formula-assigned data set from FT-ICR MS. MoleTrans includes the classical but fundamental analysis/visualization techniques (e.g., chemodiversity, multivariate statistics, van Krevelen diagrams, formula composition plots, Kendrick Mass Defect (KMD) based homologous series analysis). Users can explore the putative molecular transformation relations in single or multiple samples using a Paired Mass Distance (PMD) network in a flexible manner (e.g., user-defined mass errors and reference transformation groups, etc.). This unique tool also supports the machine learning (ML) workflow (data processing and training models) for explaining the molecular transformation behaviors between samples (e.g., exploring the disappeared, resistant, and newly appeared formulas during the transformation). Therefore, MoleTrans provides the opportunity to unravel the molecular fingerprint in DOM mixtures in a comprehensive, flexible, and reproducible way.

ADAP-KDB	GC-MS			We report the development of a spectral knowledgebase named ADAP-KDB for tracking and prioritizing unknown gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) spectra in the NIH’s Metabolomics Data Repository—a national and international repository for metabolomics data. ADAP-KDB consists of two parts. One part is a computational workflow that preprocesses raw mass spectrometry data and derives consensus mass spectra. The other part is a web portal for users to browse the consensus spectra and match query spectra against them. For each consensus spectrum, the Gini-Simpson diversity index and the p-value from χ2 goodness-of-fit test are calculated to measure its statistical significance, which enables prioritization of unknown mass spectra for subsequent costly compound identification.

CRISP	GC-MS		Yes	Two-dimensional gas chromatography–time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC × GC–TOFMS) provides a large amount of molecular information from biological samples. However, the lack of a comprehensive compound library or customizable bioinformatics tool is currently a challenge in GC × GC–TOFMS data analysis. We present an open-source deep learning (DL) software called contour regions of interest (ROI) identification, simulation and untargeted metabolomics profiler (CRISP). CRISP integrates multiple customizable deep neural network architectures for assisting the semi-automated identification of ROIs, contour synthesis, resolution enhancement and classification of GC × GC–TOFMS-based contour images. The approach includes the novel aggregate feature representative contour (AFRC) construction and stacked ROIs. This generates an unbiased contour image dataset that enhances the contrasting characteristics between different test groups and can be suitable for small sample sizes. The utility of the generative models and the accuracy and efficacy of the platform were demonstrated using a dataset of GC × GC–TOFMS contour images from patients with late-stage diabetic nephropathy and healthy control groups. CRISP successfully constructed AFRC images and identified over five ROIs to create a deepstacked dataset. The high fidelity, 512 × 512-pixels generative model was trained as a generator with a Fréchet inception distance of <47.00. The trained classifier achieved an AUROC of >0.96 and a classification accuracy of >95.00% for datasets with and without column bleed. Overall, CRISP demonstrates good potential as a DL-based approach for the rapid analysis of 4-D GC × GC–TOFMS untargeted metabolite profiles by directly implementing contour images. CRISP is available at https://github.com/vivekmathema/GCxGC-CRISP.

eROI	GC-MS			Background The application of Gas Chromatography coupled with Orbitrap High-Resolution Mass Spectrometry (GC-Orbitrap HRMS) in plant metabolomics presents challenges including substantial data storage requirements, system complexity, and particularly the prevalence of co-eluted peaks in elution profiles. These limitations necessitate the integration of chemometric smart tools to extract interpretable mass spectra from complex chromatographic fingerprints. However, the direct applicability of multivariate resolution algorithms to GC-Orbitrap HRMS datasets remains limited. The existing deconvolution platforms exhibit operational constraints such as insensitivity toward embedded peaks and prerequisite data pretreatment. Results Using Cyperus rotundus and Curcumae Radix as model medicinal plants, this study developed an equidistant Region of Interest (eROI) strategy to enhance metabolite annotation reliability. The eROI method systematically converts raw datasets into structured matrices with standardized dimensions, effectively preserving m/z reading for subsequent analytical phases. We implemented scenario-specific combinations of eROI with three multivariate curve resolution (MCR) techniques to isolate pure component spectra from co-eluted chromatographic features. Comprehensive metabolite annotation was achieved through systematic spectral interpretation of fragmentation patterns, supplemented by predictive mass spectral analysis when database matching proved inconclusive. Detailed validation using volatile-metabolomics fingerprints from both botanical species accompanies each methodological stage. Significance Our work establishes a novel data reduction framework for GC-HRMS applications, enabling robust multi-modal chromatographic deconvolution. The integrated eROI-MCR methodology provides a validated solution for obtaining reliable qualitative and quantitative results in non-targeted plant-metabolomics studies.

GcDUO	GC-MS			Comprehensive 2D gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC × GC–MS) is a powerful analytical technique. However, the complexity and volume of data generated pose significant challenges for data processing and interpretation, limiting a broader adoption. Chemometric approaches, particularly multiway models like Parallel Factor Analysis (PARAFAC), have proven effective in addressing these challenges by enabling the extraction of meaningful chemical information from multi-dimensional datasets. However, traditional PARAFAC is constrained by its assumption of data tri-linearity, which may not be valid in all cases, leading to potential inaccuracies. To overcome these limitations, we present GcDUO, an open-source software implemented in R, designed specifically for the processing and analysis of GC × GC–MS data. GcDUO integrates advanced chemometric methods, including both PARAFAC and PARAFAC2, for a more accurate and comprehensive analysis. PARAFAC is particularly useful for deconvoluting overlapping peaks and extracting pure chemical signals, while PARAFAC2 relaxes de tri-linearity constraint, allowing the alignment between samples. The software is structured into six modules—data import, region of interest (ROI) selection, deconvolution, peak annotation, data integration, and visualization—facilitating comprehensive and flexible data processing. GcDUO was validated against the gold-standard software for comprehensive GC, demonstrating a high correlation (R2 = 0.9) in peak area measurements, confirming its effectiveness and reliability. GcDUO provides a valuable, open-source platform for researchers in metabolomics and related fields, enabling more accessible and customizable GC × GC–MS data analysis.

GC–MS instruments produce both electron impact mass spectra (EI-MS) and retention index (RI) data for as few as one, to as many as hundreds of different compounds. Matching the measured EI-MS, RI or EI-MS + RI data to experimentally collected EI-MS and/or RI reference libraries allows facile compound identification. However, the number of available experimental RI and EI-MS reference spectra, especially for metabolomics or exposomics-related studies, is disappointingly small. Using machine learning to accurately predict the EI-MS spectra and/or RIs for millions of metabolomics and/or exposomics-relevant compounds could (partially) solve this spectral matching problem. This computational approach to compound identification is called in silico metabolomics. GCMS-ID brings this concept of in silico metabolomics closer to reality by intelligently integrating two of our previously published webservers: CFM-EI and RIpred. CFM-EI is an EI-MS spectral prediction webserver, and RIpred is a Kovats RI prediction webserver. We have found that GCMS-ID can accurately identify compounds from experimental RI, EI-MS or RI + EI-MS data through matching to its own large library of >1 million predicted RI/EI-MS values generated for metabolomics/exposomics-relevant compounds. GCMS-ID can also predict the RI or EI-MS spectrum from a user-submitted structure or annotate a user-submitted EI-MS spectrum. GCMS-ID is freely available at https://gcms-id.ca/.

isoSCAN	GC-MS			Isotopic-labeling experiments have been valuable to monitor the flux of metabolic reactions in biological systems, which is crucial to understand homeostatic alterations with disease. Experimental determination of metabolic fluxes can be inferred from a characteristic rearrangement of stable isotope tracers (e.g., 13C or 15N) that can be detected by mass spectrometry (MS). Metabolites measured are generally members of well-known metabolic pathways, and most of them can be detected using both gas chromatography (GC)-MS and liquid chromatography (LC)-MS. In here, we show that GC methods coupled to chemical ionization (CI) MS have a clear advantage over alternative methodologies due to GC’s superior chromatography separation efficiency and the fact that CI is a soft ionization technique that yields identifiable protonated molecular ion peaks. We tested diverse GC-CI-MS setups, including methane and isobutane reagent gases, triple quadrupole (QqQ) MS in SIM mode, or selected ion clusters using optimized narrow windows (∼10 Da) in scan mode, and standard full scan methods using high resolution GC-(q)TOF and GC-Orbitrap systems. Isobutane as a reagent gas in combination with both low-resolution (LR) and high-resolution (HR) MS showed the best performance, enabling precise detection of isotopologues in most metabolic intermediates of central carbon metabolism. Finally, with the aim of overcoming manual operations, we developed an R-based tool called isoSCAN that automatically quantifies all isotopologues of intermediate metabolites of glycolysis, TCA cycle, amino acids, pentose phosphate pathway, and urea cycle, from LRMS and HRMS data.

MetaboPAC	GC-MS			Metabolomics, the large-scale study of metabolites, has significant appeal as a source of information for metabolic modeling and other scientific applications. One common approach for measuring metabolomics data is gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). However, GC-MS metabolomics data are typically reported as relative abundances, precluding their use with approaches and tools where absolute concentrations are necessary. While chemical standards can be used to help provide quantification, their use is time-consuming, expensive, or even impossible due to their limited availability. The ability to infer absolute concentrations from GC-MS metabolomics data without chemical standards would have significant value. We hypothesized that when analyzing time-course metabolomics datasets, the mass balances of metabolism and other biological information could provide sufficient information towards inference of absolute concentrations. To demonstrate this, we developed and characterized MetaboPAC, a computational framework that uses two approaches—one based on kinetic equations and another using biological heuristics—to predict the most likely response factors that allow translation between relative abundances and absolute concentrations. When used to analyze noiseless synthetic data generated from multiple types of kinetic rate laws, MetaboPAC performs significantly better than negative control approaches when 20% of kinetic terms are known a priori. Under conditions of lower sampling frequency and high noise, MetaboPAC is still able to provide significant inference of concentrations in 3 of 4 models studied. This provides a starting point for leveraging biological knowledge to extract concentration information from time-course intracellular GC-MS metabolomics datasets, particularly for systems that are well-studied and have partially known kinetic structures.

mzrtsim	GC-MS			Reproducibility of data analysis is pivotal in the context of nontargeted metabolomics based on mass spectrometry coupled with chromatography. While various algorithms have been proposed for feature or peak extraction, their validation often revolves around a limited set of known compounds or standards. While data simulation is widely used in other omics studies, simulations are focused on the feature level, neglecting uncertainties inherent in the feature or peak extraction process for metabolomics mass spectrometry data. In this technique note, we introduce an R package called “mzrtsim”’ to simulate gas/liquid chromatography full scan raw data in the mzML format. Unlike simulations solely based on virtual features, our approach leverages experimental spectral data from MassBank of North America (MoNA) and the human metabolome database (HMDB). We developed algorithms to simulate chromatographic peaks, accounting for the tailing factor. The results of our study demonstrate the potential of this tool for comparing established metabolomics software (e.g., XCMS, mzMine, and OpenMS) against ground truth. We found that the investigated software introduced false positive peaks and/or loss of compounds with fewer peaks. They also showed different sensitivity to the tailing and leading peaks. This R package is free and available online (https://github.com/yufree/mzrtsim).	mzrtsim: Raw Data Simulation for Reproducible Gas/Liquid Chromatography–Mass Spectrometry-Based Nontargeted Metabolomics Data Analysis	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c01213?casa_token=BSO_8ydQr30AAAAA:DxeBVB-BqqnYPxDS7dCcC3iIx9JD3KLbO1cWdLyQnLPsRC-IXH42cwHysSClS4KX-MU5IAe9VUvosZZgM_I&casa_token=trHS5wnQpyQAAAAA:KOI-pZNwrKKayowL7r5nsXo2lmJpuRbqfrFF9-YnuEetFgzRVGnlznNvXUTNVXEGBx-2gX1kTAxYA8LTYjQ#	Analytical chemistry	Yu, M., & Philip, V.

RIpred	GC-MS			We describe a freely available web server called Retention Index Predictor (RIpred) (https://ripred.ca) that rapidly and accurately predicts Gas Chromatographic Kováts Retention Indices (RI) using SMILES strings as chemical structure input. RIpred performs RI prediction for three different stationary phases (semi-standard non-polar (SSNP), standard non-polar (SNP), and standard polar (SP)) for both derivatized (trimethylsilyl (TMS) and tert‑butyldimethylsilyl (TBDMS) derivatized) and underivatized (base compound) forms of GC-amenable structures. RIpred was developed to address the need for freely available, fast, highly accurate RI predictions for a wide range of derivatized and underivatized chemicals for all common GC stationary phases. RIpred was trained using a Graph Neural Network (GNN) that used compound structures, their extracted features (mostly atom-level features) and the GC-RI data from the National Institute of Standards and Technology databases (NIST 17 and NIST 20). We curated this NIST 17 and NIST 20 GC-RI data, which is available for all three stationary phases, to create appropriate inputs (molecular graphs in this case) needed to enhance our model performance. The performance of different RIpred predictive models was evaluated using 10-fold cross validation (CV). The best performing RIpred models were identified and when tested on hold-out test sets from all stationary phases, achieved a Mean Absolute Error (MAE) of <73 RI units (SSNP: 16.5–29.5, SNP: 38.5–45.9, SP: 46.52–72.53). The Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) of these models were typically within 3% (SSNP: 0.78–1.62%, SNP: 1.87–2.88%, SP: 2.34–4.05%). When compared to the best performing model by Qu et al., 2021, RIpred performed similarly (MAE of 16.57 RI units [RIpred] vs. 16.84 RI units [Qu et al., 2021 predictor] for derivatized compounds). RIpred also includes ∼5 million predicted RI values for all GC-amenable compounds (∼57,000) in the Human Metabolome Database HMDB 5.0 (Wishart et al., 2022).

SERDA	GC-MS			Large-scale metabolomics assays are widely used in epidemiology for biomarker discovery and risk assessments. However, systematic errors introduced by instrumental signal drifting pose a big challenge in large-scale assays, especially for derivatization-based gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS). Here, we compare the results of different normalization methods for a study with more than 4000 human plasma samples involved in a type 2 diabetes cohort study, in addition to 413 pooled quality control (QC) samples, 413 commercial pooled plasma samples, and a set of 25 stable isotope-labeled internal standards used for every sample. Data acquisition was conducted across 1.2 years, including seven column changes. In total, 413 pooled QC (training) and 413 BioIVT samples (validation) were used for normalization comparisons. Surprisingly, neither internal standards nor sum-based normalizations yielded median precision of less than 30% across all 563 metabolite annotations. While the machine-learning-based SERRF algorithm gave 19% median precision based on the pooled quality control samples, external cross-validation with BioIVT plasma pools yielded a median 34% relative standard deviation (RSD). We developed a new method: systematic error reduction by denoising autoencoder (SERDA). SERDA lowered the median standard deviations of the training QC samples down to 16% RSD, yielding an overall error of 19% RSD when applied to the independent BioIVT validation QC samples. This is the largest study on GC–MS metabolomics ever reported, demonstrating that technical errors can be normalized and handled effectively for this assay. SERDA was further validated on two additional large-scale GC–MS-based human plasma metabolomics studies, confirming the superior performance of SERDA over SERRF or sum normalizations.

uafR 	GC-MS			Chemical information has become increasingly ubiquitous and has outstripped the pace of analysis and interpretation. We have developed an R package, uafR, that automates a grueling retrieval process for gas -chromatography coupled mass spectrometry (GC -MS) data and allows anyone interested in chemical comparisons to quickly perform advanced structural similarity matches. Our streamlined cheminformatics workflows allow anyone with basic experience in R to pull out component areas for tentative compound identifications using the best published understanding of molecules across samples (pubchem.gov). Interpretations can now be done at a fraction of the time, cost, and effort it would typically take using a standard chemical ecology data analysis pipeline. The package was tested in two experimental contexts: (1) A dataset of purified internal standards, which showed our algorithms correctly identified the known compounds with R2 values ranging from 0.827–0.999 along concentrations ranging from 1 × 10−5 to 1 × 103 ng/μl, (2) A large, previously published dataset, where the number and types of compounds identified were comparable (or identical) to those identified with the traditional manual peak annotation process, and NMDS analysis of the compounds produced the same pattern of significance as in the original study. Both the speed and accuracy of GC -MS data processing are drastically improved with uafR because it allows users to fluidly interact with their experiment following tentative library identifications [i.e. after the m/z spectra have been matched against an installed chemical fragmentation database (e.g. NIST)]. Use of uafR will allow larger datasets to be collected and systematically interpreted quickly. Furthermore, the functions of uafR could allow backlogs of previously collected and annotated data to be processed by new personnel or students as they are being trained. This is critical as we enter the era of exposomics, metabolomics, volatilomes, and landscape level, high-throughput chemotyping. This package was developed to advance collective understanding of chemical data and is applicable to any research that benefits from GC -MS analysis. It can be downloaded for free along with sample datasets from Github at github.org/castratton/uafR or installed directly from R or RStudio using the developer tools: ‘devtools::install_github(“castratton/uafR”)’.

UniqPy	GC-MS			Short-chain fatty acids are metabolites widely presented in many natural sources, including human feces and blood. Estimation of their composition is a common procedure, usually performed using nuclear magnetic resonance or gas chromatography with a flame ionization detector. However, the commonly used methods often depend on specific sample preparation, such as filtration and homogenization. The gas-chromatography/mass-spectrometry (GC/MS) method with headspace extraction allows sample preparation to be kept to a minimum regardless of the physical state of the sample, which can be potentially useful in metabolomics research of complex natural samples such as blood or feces. In this work, we have demonstrated the applicability of Headspace GC-MS for estimating short chain fatty acid (SCFA) composition. The main problem here is the complex, non-linear dependence between the composition of the compounds in the source phase and the relative pressures in the vapor phase, which are directly measured by this method. We have implemented a thermodynamic model that performs the reverse transformation of relative abundances in the vapor phase to relative concentrations in the liquid phase, and have tested it on some synthetic SCFA mixtures. The developed method is available as a pip package called UniqPy and can be used to describe liquid-vapor equilibrium for any multicomponent system if a sufficient amount of training data is provided. The gas chromatography method with headspace extraction in conjunction with the UniqPy data transformation showed satisfactory quantification accuracy for propionic acid, butyric acid, isobutyric acid, and valeric acid (R-squared > 0.96). The applicability of the method was additionally demonstrated on a series of fecal samples.

SpecTUS	GC-MS		Yes	Compound identification and structure annotation from mass spectra is a well-established task widely applied in drug detection, criminal forensics, small molecule biomarker discovery and chemical engineering. We propose SpecTUS: Spectral Translator for Unknown Structures, a deep neural model that addresses the task of structural annotation of small molecules from low-resolution gas chromatography electron ionization mass spectra (GC-EI-MS). Our model analyzes the spectra in \textit{de novo} manner -- a direct translation from the spectra into 2D-structural representation. Our approach is particularly useful for analyzing compounds unavailable in spectral libraries. In a rigorous evaluation of our model on the novel structure annotation task across different libraries, we outperformed standard database search techniques by a wide margin. On a held-out testing set, including \numprint{28267} spectra from the NIST database, we show that our model's single suggestion perfectly reconstructs 43\% of the subset's compounds. This single suggestion is strictly better than the candidate of the database hybrid search (common method among practitioners) in 76\% of cases. In a~still affordable scenario of~10 suggestions, perfect reconstruction is achieved in 65\%, and 84\% are better than the hybrid search.

FluoroMatch 2.0	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			Because of the pervasiveness, persistence, and toxicity of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), there is growing concern over PFAS contamination, exposures, and health effects. The diversity of potential PFAS is astounding, with nearly 10,000 PFAS catalogued in databases to date (and growing). The ability to detect the thousands of known PFAS, and discover previously uncatalogued PFAS, is necessary to understand the scope of PFAS contamination and to identify appropriate remediation and regulatory solutions. Current non-targeted methods for PFAS analysis require manual curation and are time-consuming, prone to error, and not comprehensive. FluoroMatch Flow 2.0 is the first software to cover all steps of data processing for PFAS discovery in liquid chromatography–high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry samples. These steps include feature detection, feature blank filtering, exact mass matching to catalogued PFAS, mass defect filtering, homologous series detection, retention time pattern analysis, class-based MS/MS screening, fragment screening, and predicted MS/MS from SMILES structures. In addition, a comprehensive confidence level criterion is implemented to help users understand annotation certainty and integrate various layers of evidence to reduce overreporting. Applying the software to aqueous film forming foam analysis, we discovered over one thousand likely PFAS including previously unreported species. Furthermore, we were able to filter out 96% of features which were likely not PFAS. FluoroMatch Flow 2 increased coverage of likely PFAS by over tenfold compared to the previous release. This software will enable researchers to better characterize PFAS in the environment and in biological systems.

GNPS2	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			Metabolism is a fundamental process that shapes the pharmacological and toxicological profiles of drugs, making metabolite identification and analysis critical in drug development and biological research. Global Natural Products Social Networking (GNPS) is a community-driven infrastructure for mass spectrometry data analysis, storage and knowledge dissemination. GNPS2 is an improved version of the platform offering higher processing speeds, improved data analysis tools and a more intuitive user interface. Molecular networking based on tandem mass spectrometry spectral alignments, combined with other tools in the GNPS2 analysis environment, enables the discovery of candidate drug metabolites without prior knowledge, even from complex biological matrices. This protocol represents an extension of a previously established protocol for fundamental molecular networking in GNPS, with a specific focus on metabolism studies. This article uses the example of the drug sildenafil to identify candidate metabolites obtained from liquid chromatography–quadrupole time-of-flight mass spectrometry analysis of liver microsomal fractions and mice plasma to guide the reader through a step-by-step process consisting of five GNPS2-based analytical workflows. It demonstrates how the tools in GNPS2 can be used not only to identify candidate drug metabolites from in vitro studies but also to evaluate the translational relevance of these in vitro findings to humans by using reverse metabolomics. We provide a step-by-step analytical approach based on published studies to showcase how GNPS2 can be effectively applied in drug metabolism studies.

MassCube	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			Nontargeted peak detection in LC-MS-based metabolomics must become robust and benchmarked. We present MassCube, a Python-based open-source framework for MS data processing that we systematically benchmark against other algorithms and different types of input data. From raw data, peaks are detected by constructing mass traces through signal clustering and Gaussian-filter assisted edge detection. Peaks are then grouped for adduct and in-source fragment detection, and compounds are annotated by both identity- and fuzzy searches. Final data tables undergo quality controls and can be used for metabolome-informed phenotype prediction. Peak detection in MassCube achieves 100% signal coverage with comprehensive reporting of chromatographic metadata for quality assurance. MassCube outperforms MS-DIAL, MZmine3 or XCMS for speed, isomer detection, and accuracy. It supports diverse numerical routines for MS data analysis while maintaining efficiency, capable for handling 105 GB of Astral MS data on a laptop within 64 min, while other programs took 8–24 times longer. MassCube automatically detected age, sex and regional differences when applied to the Metabolome Atlas of the Aging Mouse Brain data despite batch effects. MassCube is available at https://github.com/huaxuyu/masscube for direct use or implementation into larger applications in omics or biomedical research.

MAVEN2	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			MAVEN, an open-source software program for analysis of LC-MS metabolomics data, was originally released in 2010. As mass spectrometry has advanced in the intervening years, MAVEN has been periodically updated to reflect this advancement. This manuscript describes a major update to the program, MAVEN2, which supports LC-MS/MS analysis of metabolomics and lipidomics samples. We have developed algorithms to support MS/MS spectral matching and efficient search of large-scale fragmentation libraries. We explore the ability of our approach to separate authentic from spurious metabolite identifications using a set of standards spiked into water and yeast backgrounds. To support our improved lipid identification workflow, we introduce a novel in-silico lipidomics library covering major lipid classes and compare searches using our novel library to searches with existing in-silico lipidomics libraries. MAVEN2 source code and cross-platform application installers are freely available for download from GitHub under a GNU permissive license [ver 3], as are the in silico lipidomics libraries and corresponding code repository.

MAW	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			Mapping the chemical space of compounds to chemical structures remains a challenge in metabolomics. Despite the advancements in untargeted liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC–MS) to achieve a high-throughput profile of metabolites from complex biological resources, only a small fraction of these metabolites can be annotated with confidence. Many novel computational methods and tools have been developed to enable chemical structure annotation to known and unknown compounds such as in silico generated spectra and molecular networking. Here, we present an automated and reproducible Metabolome Annotation Workflow (MAW) for untargeted metabolomics data to further facilitate and automate the complex annotation by combining tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) input data pre-processing, spectral and compound database matching with computational classification, and in silico annotation. MAW takes the LC-MS2 spectra as input and generates a list of putative candidates from spectral and compound databases. The databases are integrated via the R package Spectra and the metabolite annotation tool SIRIUS as part of the R segment of the workflow (MAW-R). The final candidate selection is performed using the cheminformatics tool RDKit in the Python segment (MAW-Py). Furthermore, each feature is assigned a chemical structure and can be imported to a chemical structure similarity network. MAW is following the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) principles and has been made available as the docker images, maw-r and maw-py. The source code and documentation are available on GitHub (https://github.com/zmahnoor14/MAW). The performance of MAW is evaluated on two case studies. MAW can improve candidate ranking by integrating spectral databases with annotation tools like SIRIUS which contributes to an efficient candidate selection procedure. The results from MAW are also reproducible and traceable, compliant with the FAIR guidelines.

MeRgeION	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			Small molecule structure elucidation using tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) plays a crucial role in life science, bioanalytical, and pharmaceutical research. There is a pressing need for increased throughput of compound identification and transformation of historical data into information-rich spectral databases. Meanwhile, molecular networking, a recent bioinformatic framework, provides global displays and system-level understanding of complex LC-MS/MS data sets. Herein we present meRgeION, a multifunctional, modular, and flexible R-based toolbox to streamline spectral database building, automated structural elucidation, and molecular networking. The toolbox offers diverse tuning parameters and the possibility to combine various algorithms in the same pipeline. As an open-source R package, meRgeION is ideally suited for building spectral databases and molecular networks from privacy-sensitive and preliminary data. Using meRgeION, we have created an integrated spectral database covering diverse pharmaceutical compounds that was successfully applied to annotate drug-related metabolites from a published nontargeted metabolomics data set as well as reveal the chemical space behind this complex data set through molecular networking. Moreover, the meRgeION-based processing workflow has demonstrated the usefulness of a spectral library search and molecular networking for pharmaceutical forced degradation studies. meRgeION is freely available at: https://github.com/daniellyz/meRgeION2.

Metabox 2.0	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			In classic semiquantitative metabolomics, metabolite intensities are affected by biological factors and other unwanted variations. A systematic evaluation of the data processing methods is crucial to identify adequate processing procedures for a given experimental setup. Current comparative studies are mostly focused on peak area data but not on absolute concentrations. In this study, we evaluated data processing methods to produce outputs that were most similar to the corresponding absolute quantified data. We examined the data distribution characteristics, fold difference patterns between 2 metabolites, and sample variance. We used 2 metabolomic datasets from a retail milk study and a lupus nephritis cohort as test cases. When studying the impact of data normalization, transformation, scaling, and combinations of these methods, we found that the cross-contribution compensating multiple standard normalization (ccmn) method, followed by square root data transformation, was most appropriate for a well-controlled study such as the milk study dataset. Regarding the lupus nephritis cohort study, only ccmn normalization could slightly improve the data quality of the noisy cohort. Since the assessment accounted for the resemblance between processed data and the corresponding absolute quantified data, our results denote a helpful guideline for processing metabolomic datasets within a similar context (food and clinical metabolomics). Finally, we introduce Metabox 2.0, which enables thorough analysis of metabolomic data, including data processing, biomarker analysis, integrative analysis, and data interpretation. It was successfully used to process and analyze the data in this study. An online web version is available at http://metsysbio.com/metabox.

MetEx	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			Advances in next-generation DNA sequencing technologies, bioinformatics, and mass spectrometry-based metabolite detection have ushered in a new era of natural product discovery. Microbial secondary metabolomes are complex, especially when otherwise silent biosynthetic genes are activated, and there is therefore a need for data analysis software to explore and map the resulting multidimensional datasets. To that end, we herein report the Metabolomics Explorer (MetEx), a publicly available web application for the analysis of parallel liquid chromatography-coupled mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based metabolomics data. MetEx is a highly interactive application that facilitates visualization and analysis of complex metabolomics datasets, consisting of retention time, m/z, and MS intensity features, as a function of hundreds of conditions or elicitors. The software enables prioritization of leads from three-dimensional maps, extraction of two-dimensional slices from various higher order plots, organization of datasets by elicitor chemotypes, customizable library-based dereplication, and automatically scored lead selection. We describe the application of MetEx to the first UPLC–MS-guided high-throughput elicitor screen in which Burkholderia gladioli was challenged with 750 elicitors, and the resulting profiles were interrogated by UPLC-Qtof-MS and subsequently analyzed with the app. We demonstrate the utility of MetEx by reporting elicitors for several cryptic metabolite groups and by uncovering new natural products that remain to be characterized.

PlantMetSuite	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			The advancement of mass spectrometry technologies has revolutionised plant metabolomics research by enabling the acquisition of raw metabolomics data. However, the identification, analysis, and visualisation of these data require specialised tools. Existing solutions lack a dedicated plant-specific metabolite database and pose usability challenges. To address these limitations, we developed PlantMetSuite, a web-based tool for comprehensive metabolomics analysis and visualisation. PlantMetSuite encompasses interactive bioinformatics tools and databases specifically tailored to plant metabolomics data, facilitating upstream-to-downstream analysis in metabolomics and supporting integrative multi-omics investigations. PlantMetSuite can be accessed directly through a user’s browser without the need for installation or programming skills. The tool is freely available and will undergo regular updates and expansions to incorporate additional libraries and newly published metabolomics analysis methods. The tool’s significance lies in empowering researchers with an accessible and customisable platform for unlocking plant metabolomics insights.

Workflow4Metabolomics	Holistic/ Standalone Tools			Abstract Various spectrometric methods can be used to conduct metabolomics studies. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or mass spectrometry (MS) coupled with separation methods, such as liquid or gas chromatography (LC and GC, respectively), are the most commonly used techniques. Once the raw data have been obtained, the real challenge lies in the bioinformatics required to conduct: (i) data processing (including preprocessing, normalization, and quality control); (ii) statistical analysis for comparative studies (such as univariate and multivariate analyses, including PCA or PLS‐DA/OPLS‐DA); (iii) annotation of the metabolites of interest; and (iv) interpretation of the relationships between key metabolites and the relevant phenotypes or scientific questions to be addressed. Here, we will introduce and detail a stepwise protocol for use of the Workflow4Metabolomics platform (W4M), which provides user‐friendly access to workflows for processing of LC–MS, GC–MS, and NMR data. Those modular and extensible workflows are composed of existing standalone components (e.g., XCMS and CAMERA packages) as well as a suite of complementary W4M‐implemented modules. This tool suite is accessible worldwide through a web interface and is hosted on UseGalaxy France. The extensible Virtual Research Environment (VRE) provided offers pre‐configured workflows for metabolomics communities (platforms, end users, etc.), as well as possibilities for sharing among users. By providing a consistent ecosystem of tools and workflows through Galaxy, W4M makes it possible to process MS and NMR data from hundreds of samples using an ordinary personal computer, after step‐by‐step workflow optimization. © 2025 Wiley Periodicals LLC.Basic Protocol 1: W4M account creation, working history preparation, and data uploadSupport Protocol 1: How to prepare an NMR zip fileSupport Protocol 2: How to convert MS data from proprietary format to open formatSupport Protocol 3: How to get help with W4M (IFB forum) and how to report a problem on the GitHub repositoryBasic Protocol 2: LC–MS data processingAlternate Protocol 1: GC–MS data processingAlternate Protocol 2: NMR data processingBasic Protocol 3: Statistical analysisBasic Protocol 4: Annotation of metabolites from LC–MS dataAlternate Protocol 3: Annotation of metabolites from NMR data	Workflow4Metabolomics (W4M): A User-Friendly Metabolomics Platform for Analysis of Mass Spectrometry and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance Data	https://currentprotocols.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cpz1.70095	Current Protocols	Delporte, Cédric, Tremblay‐Franco, Marie, Guitton, Yann, Canlet, Cécile, Weber, Ralf J.

13C-SpaceM	Imaging MS			Abstract Metabolism has emerged as a key factor in homeostasis and disease including cancer. Yet, little is known about the heterogeneity of metabolic activity of cancer cells due to the lack of tools to directly probe it. Here, we present a novel method,13C-SpaceM for spatial single-cell isotope tracing of glucose-dependentde novolipogenesis. The method combines imaging mass spectrometry for spatially-resolved detection of13C6-glucose-derived13C label incorporated into esterified fatty acids with microscopy and computational methods for data integration and analysis. We validated13C-SpaceM on a spatially-heterogeneous normoxia-hypoxia model of liver cancer cells. Investigating cultured cells, we revealed single-cell heterogeneity of lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool labelling degree upon ACLY knockdown that is hidden in the bulk analysis and its effect on synthesis of individual fatty acids. Next, we adapted13C-SpaceM to analyze tissue sections of mice harboring isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH)-mutant gliomas. We found a strong induction ofde novofatty acid synthesis in the tumor tissue compared to the surrounding brain. Comparison of fatty acid isotopologue patterns revealed elevated uptake of mono-unsaturated and essential fatty acids in the tumor. Furthermore, our analysis uncovered substantial spatial heterogeneity in the labelling of the lipogenic acetyl-CoA pool indicative of metabolic reprogramming during microenvironmental adaptation. Overall,13C-SpaceM enables novel ways for spatial probing of metabolic activity at the single cell level. Additionally, this methodology provides unprecedented insight into fatty acid uptake, synthesis and modification in normal and cancerous tissues.	13C-SpaceM: Spatial single-cell isotope tracing reveals heterogeneity of de novo fatty acid synthesis in cancer 	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.08.18.553810v2	bioRxiv	Buglakova, Elena, Ekelöf, Måns, Schwaiger-Haber, Michaela, Schlicker, Lisa, Molenaar, Martijn R., Mohammed, Shahraz, Stuart, Lachlan, Eisenbarth, Andreas, Hilsenstein, Volker, Patti, Gary J., Schulze, Almut, Snaebjornsson, Marteinn T., & Alexandrov, Theodore (2023). <sup>13</sup>C-SpaceM: Spatial single-cell isotope tracing reveals heterogeneity of<i>de novo</i>fatty acid synthesis in cancer. . https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.18.553810	E.

Aird-MSI	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging has emerged as a pivotal tool in spatial metabolomics, yet its reliance on the imzML format poses critical challenges in data storage, transmission, and computational efficiency. While imzML ensures cross-platform compatibility, its lower compressed binary architecture results in large file sizes and high parsing overhead, hindering cloud-based analysis and real-time visualization. This study introduces an enhanced Aird compression format optimized for spatial metabolomics through two innovations: (1) a dynamic combinatorial compression algorithm for integer-based encoding of m/z and intensity data; (2) a coordinate-separation storage strategy for rapid spatial indexing. Experimental validation on 47 public data sets demonstrated significant performance gains. Compared to imzML, Aird achieved a 70% reduction in storage footprint (mean compression ratio: 30.89%) while maintaining near-lossless data precision (F1-score = 99.75% at 0.1 ppm m/z tolerance). For high-precision-controlled data sets, Aird accelerated loading speeds by 13-fold in MZmine. The Aird format overcomes crucial bottlenecks in spatial metabolomics by harmonizing storage efficiency, computational speed, and analytical precision, reducing I/O latency for large cohorts. By achieving near-native feature detection accuracy, Aird establishes a robust infrastructure for translational applications, including disease biomarker discovery and pharmacokinetic imaging.

deepPseudoMSI	Imaging MS		Yes	Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based untargeted metabolomics provides systematic profiling of metabolic. Yet, its applications in precision medicine (disease diagnosis) have been limited by several challenges, including metabolite identification, information loss and low reproducibility. Here, we present the deep-learning-based Pseudo-Mass Spectrometry Imaging (deepPseudoMSI) project (https://www.deeppseudomsi.org/), which converts LC–MS raw data to pseudo-MS images and then processes them by deep learning for precision medicine, such as disease diagnosis. Extensive tests based on real data demonstrated the superiority of deepPseudoMSI over traditional approaches and the capacity of our method to achieve an accurate individualized diagnosis. Our framework lays the foundation for future metabolic-based precision medicine.

DIMPLE	Imaging MS			Metabolic processes are essential for regulating and maintaining developmental transitions, from stem cell quiescence through differentiation. However, the distinct metabolite-driven mechanisms that are critical for development remain poorly characterized due to inherent challenges in measuring their production, localization, and function in situ. We employed desorption electrospray ionization mass spectrometry imaging (DESI-MSI) to map metabolites in the developing maize root, which has a well-characterized longitudinal gradient that encompasses developmental transitions from quiescence through proliferation and maturation. DESI-MSI enables in situ analysis of the chemical composition of tissue sections with high spatial resolution (∼50-100 µm). To identify metabolites with specific developmental enrichment patterns, we developed a computational approach called Developmental Imaging Mass Spectrometry Pipeline for Linear Evaluation (DIMPLE). DIMPLE processes mass signatures along linear gradients, generating clusters of metabolites with specific developmental enrichment patterns in the maize root. We employed this method to compare developmental enrichment of metabolites in a salt-resilient maize variety, Oaxacan Green, and a salt-susceptible variety, B73. DIMPLE identifies specific differences in the mass signatures and the overall enrichment patterns between these varieties. DIMPLE also revealed a metabolite, D-erythrose, that had different localization patterns in these varieties. We found that in salt-sensitive maize varieties, treatment with D-erythrose improves stress tolerance by increasing primary root length. Overall, DIMPLE enables comprehensive and rapid analysis of metabolite patterns along a linear gradient, revealing new biology in plant growth and stress response.

HT SpaceM	Imaging MS			Single-cell metabolomics (SCM) promises to reveal metabolism in its complexity and heterogeneity, yet current methods struggle with detecting small-molecule metabolites, throughput, and reproducibility. Addressing these gaps, we developed HT SpaceM, a high-throughput SCM method combining cell preparation on custom glass slides, small-molecule matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI) imaging mass spectrometry (MS), and batch processing. We propose a unified framework covering quality control, characterization, structural validation, and differential and functional analyses. Profiling HeLa and NIH3T3 cells, we detected 73 small-molecule metabolites validated by bulk liquid chromatography tandem MS (LC-MS/MS), achieving high reproducibility and single-cell resolution. Interrogating nine NCI-60 cancer cell lines and HeLa, we identified cell-type markers in subpopulations and metabolic hubs. Upon inhibiting glycolysis in HeLa cells, we observed emerging glucose-centered metabolic coordination and intra-condition heterogeneity. Overall, we demonstrate how HT SpaceM enables robust, large-scale SCM across over 140,000 cells from 132 samples and provide guidance on how to interpret metabolic insights beyond population averages.

i2i	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) techniques generate data that reveal spatial distributions of molecules on a surface with high sensitivity and selectivity. However, processing large volumes of mass spectrometry data into useful ion images is not trivial. Furthermore, data from MSI techniques using continuous ionization sources where data are acquired in line scans require different data handling strategies compared to data collected from pulsed ionization sources where data are acquired in grids. In addition, for continuous ionization sources, the pixel dimensions are influenced by the mass spectrometer duty cycle, which, in turn, can be controlled by the automatic gain control (AGC) for each spectrum (pixel). Currently, there is a lack of data-handling software for MSI data generated with continuous ionization sources and AGC. Here, we present ion-to-image (i2i), which is a MATLAB-based application for MSI data acquired with continuous ionization sources, AGC, high resolution, and one or several scan filters. The source code and a compiled installer are available at https://github.com/LanekoffLab/i2i. The application includes both quantitative, targeted, and nontargeted data processing strategies and enables complex data sets to be processed in minutes. The i2i application has high flexibility for generating, processing, and exporting MSI data both from simple full scans and more complex scan functions interlacing MS^n and SIM scan data sets, and we anticipate that it will become a valuable addition to the existing MSI software toolbox.

imzML Writer	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a technique that uncovers the contextual distribution of biomolecules in tissue. This involves collecting large data sets with information-rich mass spectra in each pixel. To streamline image processing and interpretation, the MSI community has developed toolboxes for image preprocessing, segmentation, statistical analysis, and visualization. These generally require data to be input as imzML files, an Extensible Markup Language file with vocabulary for mass spectrometry and imaging-specific parameters. While commercial systems (e.g., MALDI) come with proprietary file converters, to our knowledge, no open-access user-friendly converters exist for continuously acquired imaging data (e.g., nano-DESI, DESI). Here, we present imzML Writer, an easy-to-use Python application with a graphical user interface to convert data from vendor format into pixel-aligned imzML files. We package this application with imzML Scout, allowing visualization of the resulting file(s) and batch export of ion images across a range of image and data formats (e.g., PNG, TIF, CSV). To demonstrate the utility of files generated by imzML Writer, we processed nano-DESI data with popular tools such as Cardinal MSI and METASPACE. Overall, this work provides a simple open-access tool for emerging MSI modality users to access advanced MSI processing tools reliant on imzML format. ImzML Writer is available as a distributable Python package via pip or as a standalone program for Mac and PC at https://github.com/VIU-Metabolomics/imzML_Writer.	imzML Writer: An Easy-to-Use Python Pipeline for Conversion of Continuously Acquired Raw Mass Spectrometry Imaging Data to imzML Format	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c06520	ChemRxiv preprint	Monaghan, J., Nguyen, K., Woytowich, N., Keyowski, A., & Duncan, K.

LipidQMap	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool in both basic and clinical research, enabling spatial visualization of biomolecules and drugs in tissue sections. However, factors influencing mass spectrometric response during imaging are increasingly recognized for their impact on apparent molecular distribution. Quantitative mass spectrometry imaging (qMSI) addresses this variability by incorporating analytical standards that undergo the same processes as analytes. While qMSI sample preparation protocols for omics-scale quantitative lipidomics are actively evolving, software solutions for downstream data processing remain scarce. Here, we introduce LipidQMap, the first open-source platform for processing omics-scale qMSI lipidomics data. LipidQMap applies one-point calibration, normalizing annotated lipid signals against class-specific standards on a pixel-by-pixel basis, and generates concentration heat maps in pmol/mm2. The software supports centroided data import, recalibration, and lipid identification using a built-in, user-modifiable lipid database. LipidQMap resolves Na/H adduct isobaric overlaps by leveraging sodiated-to-protonated adduct ratios of standards, validated across several MSI platforms using mouse brain sections.

M2aia	Imaging MS			Background  Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a label-free analysis method for resolving bio-molecules or pharmaceuticals in the spatial domain. It offers unique perspectives for the examination of entire organs or other tissue specimens. Owing to increasing capabilities of modern MSI devices, the use of 3D and multi-modal MSI becomes feasible in routine applications—resulting in hundreds of gigabytes of data. To fully leverage such MSI acquisitions, interactive tools for 3D image reconstruction, visualization, and analysis are required, which preferably should be open-source to allow scientists to develop custom extensions. Findings  We introduce M2aia (MSI applications for interactive analysis in MITK), a software tool providing interactive and memory-efficient data access and signal processing of multiple large MSI datasets stored in imzML format. M2aia extends MITK, a popular open-source tool in medical image processing. Besides the steps of a typical signal processing workflow, M2aia offers fast visual interaction, image segmentation, deformable 3D image reconstruction, and multi-modal registration. A unique feature is that fused data with individual mass axes can be visualized in a shared coordinate system. We demonstrate features of M2aia by reanalyzing an N-glycan mouse kidney dataset and 3D reconstruction and multi-modal image registration of a lipid and peptide dataset of a mouse brain, which we make publicly available. Conclusions  To our knowledge, M2aia is the first extensible open-source application that enables a fast, user-friendly, and interactive exploration of large datasets. M2aia is applicable to a wide range of MSI analysis tasks.

macroMS	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging is well-suited to characterizing sample surfaces for their chemical content in a spatially resolved manner. However, when the surface contains small objects with significant empty spaces between them, more efficient approaches to sample acquisition are possible. Image-guided mass spectrometry (MS) enables high-throughput analysis of a diverse range of sample types, such as microbial colonies, liquid microdroplets, and others, by recognizing and analyzing selected location targets in an image. Here, we describe an imaging protocol and macroMS, an online software suite that can be used to enhance MS measurements of macroscopic samples that are imaged by a camera or a flatbed scanner. The web-based tool enables users to find and filter targets from the optical images, correct optical distortion issues for improved spatial location of selected targets, input the custom geometry files into an MS device to acquire spectra at the selected locations, and finally, perform limited data analysis and use visualization tools to aid locating samples containing compounds of interest. Using the macroMS suite, an enzyme mutant library of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and nL droplet arrays of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens have been assayed at a rate of ∼2 s/sample.	macroMS: Image-Guided Analysis of Random Objects by Matrix-Assisted Laser Desorption/Ionization Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/jasms.1c00013?casa_token=l4N7yVYinckAAAAA:qcJVIX8DLW0_AemdWne1OGcX5X4t9Xzjlf75PyNSj8PbzIfxuVSalted7riSbzVX6W5Q5exdV78Pkhq-	Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry	Choe, Kisurb, Xue, Pu, Zhao, Huimin, & Sweedler, Jonathan V.

MACS	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is an analytical technique capable of measuring and visualizing the spatial distribution of thousands of ions across a sample. Measured ions can be putatively identified and annotated by comparing their mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) to a database of known compounds. For high-resolution, accurate mass (HRAM) imaging data sets, this is commonly performed by the annotation platform METASPACE. Annotations are reported with a metabolite-signal-match (MSM) score as a measure of the annotation’s confidence level. However, the MSM scores reported by METASPACE often do not reflect a reasonable confidence level of an annotation and are not assigned consistently. The metabolite annotation confidence score (MACS) is an alternative scoring system based on fundamental mass spectrometry imaging metrics (mass measurement accuracy, spectral accuracy, and spatial distribution) to generate values that reflect the confidence of a specific annotation in HRAM-MSI data sets. Herein, the MACS system is characterized and compared to MSM scores from ions annotated by METASPACE.

mass2adduct	Imaging MS			Spatial metabolomics using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a powerful tool to map hundreds to thousands of metabolites in biological systems. One major challenge in MSI is the annotation of m/z values, which is substantially complicated by background ions introduced throughout the chemicals and equipment used during experimental procedures. Among many factors, the formation of adducts with sodium or potassium ions, or in case of matrix-assisted laser desorption ionization (MALDI)-MSI, the presence of abundant matrix clusters strongly increases total m/z peak counts. Currently, there is a limitation to identify the chemistry of the many unknown peaks to interpret their biological function. We took advantage of the co-localization of adducts with their parent ions and the accuracy of high mass resolution to estimate adduct abundance in 20 datasets from different vendors of mass spectrometers. Metabolites ranging from lipids to amines and amino acids form matrix adducts with the commonly used 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (DHB) matrix like [M + (DHB-H2O) + H]+ and [M + DHB + Na]+. Current data analyses neglect those matrix adducts and overestimate total metabolite numbers, thereby expanding the number of unidentified peaks. Our study demonstrates that MALDI-MSI data are strongly influenced by adduct formation across different sample types and vendor platforms and reveals a major influence of so far unrecognized metabolite–matrix adducts on total peak counts (up to one third). We developed a software package, mass2adduct, for the community for an automated putative assignment and quantification of metabolite–matrix adducts enabling users to ultimately focus on the biologically relevant portion of the MSI data.

MassVision	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) combines spatial and spectral data to reveal detailed molecular compositions within biological samples. Despite their immense potential, MSI workflows are hindered by the complexity and high dimensionality of the data, making their analysis computationally intensive and often requiring expertise in coding. Existing tools frequently lack the integration needed for seamless, scalable, and end-to-end workflows, forcing researchers to rely on local solutions or multiple platforms, which hinders efficiency and accessibility. We introduce MassVision, a comprehensive software platform for MSI analysis. Built on the 3D Slicer ecosystem, MassVision integrates MSI-specific functionalities while addressing general user requirements for accessibility and usability. Its intuitive interface lowers barriers for researchers with varying levels of computational expertise, while its scalability supports high-throughput studies and multislide data sets. Key functionalities include visualization, segmentation, colocalization, data set curation, data set merging, spectral and spatial preprocessing, statistical analysis, AI model training, and AI deployment on full MSI data. We detail the workflow and functionalities of MassVision and demonstrate its effectiveness through different experimental use cases such as exploratory data analysis, ion identification, and tissue-type classification on in-house and publicly available data from different MSI modalities. These use cases underscore MassVision’s ability to seamlessly integrate MSI data handling steps into a single platform and highlight its potential to reveal new insights and structures when examining biological samples. By combining cutting-edge functionality with user-centric design, MassVision addresses longstanding challenges in MSI data analysis and provides a robust tool for advancing the user’s ability to achieve biologically meaningful insights from MSI data. MassVision is freely available via 3D Slicer (documentation: https://SlicerMassVision.readthedocs.io/). The in-house MSI data have been made publicly available in MetaboLights with the identifier MTBLS12868.

Met-ID	Imaging MS			Here, we introduce Met-ID, a graphical user interface software designed to efficiently identify metabolites from MALDI-MSI data sets. Met-ID enables annotation of m/z features from any type of MALDI-MSI experiment, involving either derivatizing or conventional matrices. It utilizes structural information for derivatizing matrices to generate a subset of targets that contain only functional groups specific to the derivatization agent. The software is able to identify multiple derivatization sites on the same molecule, facilitating identification of the derivatized compound. This ability is exemplified by FMP-10, a reactive matrix that assists the covalent charge-tagging of molecules containing phenolic hydroxyl and/or primary or secondary amine groups. Met-ID also permits users to recalibrate data with known m/z ratios, boosting confidence in mass match results. Furthermore, Met-ID includes a database featuring MS2 spectra of numerous chemical standards, consisting of neurotransmitters and metabolites derivatized with FMP-10, alongside peaks for FMP-10 itself, all accessible directly through the software. The MS2 spectral database supports user-uploaded spectra and enables comparison of these spectra with user-provided tissue MS2 spectra for similarity assessment. Although initially installed with basic data, Met-ID is designed to be customizable, encouraging users to tailor the software to their specific needs. While several MSI-oriented software solutions exist, Met-ID combines both MS1 and MS2 functionalities. Developed in alignment with the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific software, Met-ID is freely available as an open-source tool on GitHub, ensuring wide accessibility and collaboration.

METASPACE-ML	Imaging MS			Imaging mass spectrometry is a powerful technology enabling spatial metabolomics, yet metabolites can be assigned only to a fraction of the data generated. METASPACE-ML is a machine learning-based approach addressing this challenge which incorporates new scores and computationally-efficient False Discovery Rate estimation. For training and evaluation, we use a comprehensive set of 1710 datasets from 159 researchers from 47 labs encompassing both animal and plant-based datasets representing multiple spatial metabolomics contexts derived from the METASPACE knowledge base. Here we show that, METASPACE-ML outperforms its rule-based predecessor, exhibiting higher precision, increased throughput, and enhanced capability in identifying low-intensity and biologically-relevant metabolites. Imaging mass spectrometry has revolutionised spatial metabolomics, but metabolites are annotated for only a fraction of the data. Here, authors show that METASPACE-ML enhances precision, increases throughput, and improves the identification of low-intensity and biologically relevant metabolites.

MetaVision3D	Imaging MS			High-resolution spatial imaging is transforming our understanding of foundational biology. Spatial metabolomics is an emerging field that enables the dissection of the complex metabolic landscape and heterogeneity from a thin tissue section. Currently, spatial metabolism highlights the remarkable complexity in two-dimensional (2D) space and is poised to be extended into the three-dimensional (3D) world of biology. Here we introduce MetaVision3D, a pipeline driven by computer vision, a branch of artificial intelligence focusing on image workflow, for the transformation of serial 2D MALDI mass spectrometry imaging sections into a high-resolution 3D spatial metabolome. Our framework uses advanced algorithms for image registration, normalization and interpolation to enable the integration of serial 2D tissue sections, thereby generating a comprehensive 3D model of unique diverse metabolites across host tissues at submesoscale. As a proof of principle, MetaVision3D was utilized to generate the mouse brain 3D metabolome atlas of normal and diseased animals (available at https://metavision3d.rc.ufl.edu) as an interactive online database and web server to further advance brain metabolism and related research.

MSI-Explorer	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) enables label-free spatial localization of biomolecules from single cells to whole tissues, making it a key technology in the growing fields of spatial omics. However, a lack of comprehensive open-source tools for MSI data analysis, visualization, and quantification has hindered its broader adoption. Napari, a widely used interactive Python-based image analysis platform, currently lacks native support for MSI data, limiting its applications in MSI research. To address this gap, we present MSI-Explorer, the first napari plugin that provides an interactive and user-friendly interface for MSI data processing, spectral analysis, molecular annotation, and quantification. By integrating napari’s advanced visualization capabilities with MSI-specific functionalities, MSI-Explorer provides image curation, multimodal, and efficient analysis of MSI data sets. As the first dedicated MSI plugin for napari, MSI-Explorer bridges the gap between spatial metabolomics and the broader bioimaging research community, promoting open, accessible, and integrated MSI data analysis.

MSIannotator	Imaging MS			Rapid and accurate metabolite annotation in mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) can improve the efficiency of spatially resolved metabolomics studies and accelerate the discovery of reliable in situ disease biomarkers. To date, metabolite annotation tools in MSI generally utilize isotopic patterns, but high-throughput fragmentation-based identification and biological and technical factors that influence structure elucidation are active challenges. Here, we proposed an organ-specific, metabolite-database-driven approach to facilitate efficient and accurate MSI metabolite annotation. Using data-dependent acquisition (DDA) in liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) to generate high-coverage product ions, we identified 1620 unique metabolites from eight mouse organs (brain, liver, kidney, heart, spleen, lung, muscle, and pancreas) and serum. Following the evaluation of the adduct form difference of metabolite ions between LC–MS and airflow-assisted desorption electrospray ionization (AFADESI)-MSI and deciphering organ-specific metabolites, we constructed a metabolite database for MSI consisting of 27,407 adduct ions. An automated annotation tool, MSIannotator, was then created to conduct metabolite annotation in the MSI dataset with high efficiency and confidence. We applied this approach to profile the spatially resolved landscape of the whole mouse body and discovered that metabolites were distributed across the body in an organ-specific manner, which even spanned different mouse strains. Furthermore, the spatial metabolic alteration in diabetic mice was delineated across different organs, exhibiting that differentially expressed metabolites were mainly located in the liver, brain, and kidney, and the alanine, aspartate, and glutamate metabolism pathway was simultaneously altered in these three organs. This approach not only enables robust metabolite annotation and visualization on a body-wide level but also provides a valuable database resource for underlying organ-specific metabolic mechanisms.

msiFlow	Imaging MS			Multimodal imaging by matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation mass spectrometry imaging (MALDI MSI) and microscopy holds potential for understanding pathological mechanisms by mapping molecular signatures from the tissue microenvironment to specific cell populations. However, existing software solutions for MALDI MSI data analysis are incomplete, require programming skills and contain laborious manual steps, hindering broadly applicable, reproducible, and high-throughput analysis to generate impactful biological discoveries. Here, we present msiFlow, an accessible open-source, platform-independent and vendor-neutral software for end-to-end, high-throughput, transparent and reproducible analysis of multimodal imaging data. msiFlow integrates all necessary steps from raw data import to analytical visualisation along with state-of-the-art and self-developed algorithms into automated workflows. Using msiFlow, we unravel the molecular heterogeneity of leukocytes in infected tissues by spatial regulation of ether-linked phospholipids containing arachidonic acid. We anticipate that msiFlow will facilitate the broad applicability of MSI in multimodal imaging to uncover context-dependent cellular regulations in disease states.	msiFlow: automated workflows for reproducible and scalable multimodal mass spectrometry imaging and microscopy data analysis	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-55306-7	Nature Communications	Spangenberg, P., Bessler, S., Widera, L., Bottek, J., Richter, M., Thiebes, S., Siemes, D., Krauß, S.

MSIGen	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides information about the spatial localization of molecules in complex samples with high sensitivity and molecular selectivity. Although point-wise data acquisition, in which mass spectra are acquired at predefined points in a grid pattern, is common in MSI, several MSI techniques use line-wise data acquisition. In line-wise mode, the imaged surface is continuously sampled along consecutive parallel lines and MSI data are acquired as a collection of line scans across the sample. Furthermore, aside from the standard imaging mode in which full mass spectra are acquired, other acquisition modes have been developed to enhance molecular specificity, enable separation of isobaric and isomeric species, and improve sensitivity to facilitate the imaging of low abundance species. These methods, including MS/MS-MSI in both MS2 and MS3 modes, multiple-reaction monitoring (MRM)-MSI, and ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)-MSI have all demonstrated their capabilities, but their broader implementation is limited by the existing MSI analysis software. Here, we present MSIGen, an open-source Python package for the visualization of MSI experiments performed in line-wise acquisition mode containing MS1, MS2, MRM, and IMS data, which is available at https://github.com/LabLaskin/MSIGen. The package supports multiple vendor-specific and open-source data formats and contains tools for targeted extraction of ion images, normalization, and exportation as images, arrays, or publication-style images. MSIGen offers multiple interfaces, allowing for accessibility and easy integration with other workflows. Considering its support for a wide variety of MSI imaging modes and vendor formats, MSIGen is a valuable tool for the visualization and analysis of MSI data.

MSIght	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has gained popularity in clinical analyses due to its high sensitivity, specificity, and throughput. However, global profiling experiments are often still restricted to LC-MS/MS analyses that lack spatial localization due to low-throughput methods for on-tissue peptide identification and confirmation. Additionally, the integration of parallel LC-MS/MS peptide confirmation, as well as histological stains for accurate mapping of identifications, presents a large bottleneck for data analysis, limiting throughput for untargeted profiling experiments. Here, we present a novel platform, termed MSIght, which automates the integration of these multiple modalities into an accessible and modular platform. Histological stains of tissue sections are coregistered to their respective MSI data sets to improve spatial localization and resolution of identified peptides. MS/MS peptide identifications via untargeted LC-MS/MS are used to confirm putative MSI identifications, thus generating MS images with greater confidence in a high-throughput, global manner. This platform has the potential to enable large-scale clinical cohorts to utilize MSI in the future for global proteomic profiling that uncovers novel biomarkers in a spatially resolved manner, thus widely expanding the utility of MSI in clinical discovery.

MSIpixel	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is commonly used to map the spatial distribution of small molecules within complex biological matrices. One of the major challenges in imaging MS-based spatial metabolomics is molecular identification and metabolite annotation, to address this limitation, annotation is often complemented with parallel bulk LC-MS2-based metabolomics to confirm and validate identifications. Here we applied MSI method, utilizing data-dependent acquisition, to visualize and identify unknown molecules in a single instrument run. To reach this aim we developed MSIpixel, a fully automated pipeline for compound annotation and quantitation in MSI experiments. It overcomes challenges in molecular identification, and improving reliability and comprehensiveness in MSI-based spatial metabolomics.

MSroi	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry has become one of the methods of choice in the analytical field due to its high sensitivity and selectivity to retrieve structural information allowing the univocal identification of compounds. From a chemometric point of view, mass spectrometry generates challenging datasets because of their large size with thousands of mass-to-charge values and with a high inherent complexity associated with the multicomponent mixtures analysed. These unresolved challenges have brought about the development of various computational approaches to enable the pre-processing of these mass spectrometry datasets. Here, we present the MSroi software in an attempt to provide a one-for-all solution in the compression and pre-processing of mass spectrometry datasets. MSroi allows the analysis of a variety of mass spectrometry datasets obtained using different acquisition approaches such as direct infusion, hyphenated to a separation technique or imaging. In all these cases, MSroi produces a highly compressed data table containing the measured intensities for relevant mass to charge values at each considered retention time or pixel. This output can be used as input for the feature detection step in, for instance, the ROIMCR approach, or used independently for subsequent multivariate chemometric analysis.

Multi‑MSI Processor	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) has emerged as a revolutionary analytical strategy in biomedical research for molecular visualization. By linking the characterization of functional metabolites with tissue architecture, it is now possible to reveal unknown biological functions of tissues. However, due to the complexity and high dimensionality of MSI data, mining bioinformatics-related peaks from batch MSI data sets and achieving complete spatially resolved metabolomics analysis remain a great challenge. Here, we propose novel MSI data processing software, Multi-MSIProcessor (MMP), which integrates the data read-in, MSI visualization, processed data preservation, and biomarker discovery functions. The MMP focuses on the AFADESI-MSI data platform but also supports mzXML and imzmL data input formats for compatibility with data generated by other MSI platforms such as MALDI/SIMS-MSI. MMP enables deep mining of batch MSI data and has flexible adaptability with the source code opened that welcomes new functions and personalized analysis strategies. Using multiple clinical biosamples with complex heterogeneity, we demonstrated that MMP can rapidly establish complete MSI analysis workflows, assess batch sample data quality, screen and annotate differential MS peaks, and obtain abnormal metabolic pathways. MMP provides a novel platform for spatial metabolomics analysis of multiple samples that could meet the diverse analysis requirements of scholars.

NGlycDB	Imaging MS			Imaging N-glycan spatial distribution in tissues using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is emerging as a promising tool in biological and clinical applications. However, there is currently no high-throughput tool for visualization and molecular annotation of N-glycans in MSI data, which significantly slows down data processing and hampers the applicability of this approach. Here, we present how METASPACE, an open-source cloud engine for molecular annotation of MSI data, can be used to automatically annotate, visualize, analyze, and interpret high-resolution mass spectrometry-based spatial N-glycomics data. METASPACE is an emerging tool in spatial metabolomics, but the lack of compatible glycan databases has limited its application for comprehensive N-glycan annotations from MSI data sets. We created NGlycDB, a public database of N-glycans, by adapting available glycan databases. We demonstrate the applicability of NGlycDB in METASPACE by analyzing MALDI-MSI data from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) human kidney and mouse lung tissue sections. We added NGlycDB to METASPACE for public use, thus, facilitating applications of MSI in glycobiology.

Pew2	Imaging MS			Open-sourced software is a key component of the mass spectrometry imaging field, where transparency in data processing is vital. Imaging of trace elements and immunohistochemically labeled biomolecules in tissue sections is typically performed using laser ablation–inductively coupled plasma–mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). However, efficient and facile processing of images is hampered by a lack of verifiable and user-friendly software that supports multiple LA-ICP-MS platforms. In this technical note, we introduce Pew2, a LA-ICP-MS specific and feature-rich open-source image processing software that is compatible with common ICP-MS vendors. Pew2 is designed to be fast and easy to use and adheres to modern visualization philosophies to maximize productivity and to minimize data interpretation errors and image anomalies.

rMSIannotation	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) consist of spatially located spectra with thousands of peaks. Only a fraction of these peaks corresponds to unique monoisotopic peaks, as mass spectra include isotopes, adducts and fragments of compounds. Current peak annotation solutions depend on matching MS features to compounds libraries. We present rMSIannotation, a peak annotation algorithm to annotate carbon isotopes and adducts in metabolomics and lipidomics imaging mass spectrometry datasets without using supporting libraries. rMSIannotation measures and evaluates the intensity ratio between carbon isotopic peaks and models their distribution across the m/z axis of the compounds in the Human Metabolome Database. Monoisotopic peak selection is based on the isotopic likelihood score (ILS) made of three components: image morphology correlation, validation of isotopic intensity ratios, and peak centroid mass deviation. rMSIannotation proposes pairs of peaks that can be adducts based on three scores: isotopic pattern coherence, image correlation and mass error. We validated rMSIannotation with three MALDI-MSI datasets which were manually annotated by experts, and compared the annotations obtained with rMSIannotation and with the METASPACE annotation platform. rMSIannotation replicated more than 90% of the manual annotation reported in FT-ICR datasets and expanded the list of annotated compounds with additional monoisotopic peaks and neutral masses. Finally, we evaluated isotopic peak annotation as a data reduction method for MSI by comparing the results of PCA and k-means segmentation before and after removing non-monoisotopic peaks. The results show that monoisotopic peaks retain most of the biologic variance in the dataset.	rMSIannotation: A peak annotation tool for mass spectrometry imaging based on the analysis of isotopic intensity ratios	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0003267021004955?via%3Dihub	Analytica Chimica Acta	Semente, L., Baquer, G., Garcia-Altares, M., Correig-Blanchar, X., & Rafols, P.

S2IsoMEr	Imaging MS			Imaging mass spectrometry (imaging MS) has advanced spatial and single-cell metabolomics, but the reliance on MS1 data complicates the accurate identification of molecular structures, not being able to resolve isomeric and isobar molecules. This prevents application of conventional methods for overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and metabolite set enrichment analysis (MSEA). To address this, we introduce S2IsoMEr R package and a web app for METASPACE, which uses bootstrapping to propagate isomeric/isobaric ambiguities into the enrichment analysis. We demonstrate S2IsoMEr for single-cell metabolomics and the METASPACE web app for spatial metabolomics. Availability and implementation  METASPACE web app can be used on existing and new datasets submitted to METASPACE (https://metaspace2020.org).

SagMSI	Imaging MS		Yes	Mass Spectrometry Imaging (MSI) is a label-free imaging technique used in spatial metabolomics to explore the distribution of various metabolites within biological tissues. Spatial segmentation plays a crucial role in the biochemical interpretation of MSI data, yet the inherent complexity of the data—characterized by large size, high dimensionality, and spectral nonlinearity—poses significant analytical challenges in MSI segmentation. Although deep learning approaches based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) have shown considerable success in spatial segmentation for biomedical imaging, they often struggle to capture the comprehensive structural information of MSI data. Results We propose SagMSI, an unsupervised graph convolution network (GCN)-based segmentation strategy that combines spatial-aware graph construction of MSI data with a GCN module within a deep neural network. This approach enables flexible, effective, and precise spatial segmentation. We applied SagMSI to both simulated data and various MSI experimental datasets and compared its performance against three commonly used segmentation methods, including t-SNE + k-means, a pipeline implemented by the R package Cardinal, and a CNN-based segmentation method. Visual comparisons with histological images and quantitative evaluations using the silhouette coefficient and adjusted rand index demonstrate that SagMSI excels in segmenting complex tissues, revealing detailed sub-structures, and delineating distinct boundaries of sub-organs with minimal noise interference. The integration of graph-based neural networks with spatially structural information offers deeper insights into spatial omics. Significance The MSI data is modelled by graph structure so as to incorporate the biomolecular profiling and spatial adjacency within neighboring pixels. The GCN framework generates meaningful pixel representations by learning local and global contextual information through the graph-based structure, thus enabling precise segmentation of MSI. The approach demonstrated high flexibility, robustness to noise, and applicability in exploring complex tissue structures and identifying marker ions associated with microregions.

SmartGate	Imaging MS			Imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) is one of the powerful tools in spatial metabolomics for obtaining metabolite data and probing the internal microenvironment of organisms. It has dramatically advanced the understanding of the structure of biological tissues and the drug treatment of diseases. However, the complexity of IMS data hinders the further acquisition of biomarkers and the study of certain specific activities of organisms. To this end, we introduce an artificial intelligence tool, SmartGate, to enable automatic peak selection and spatial structure identification in an iterative manner. SmartGate selects discriminative m/z features from the previous iteration by differential analysis and employs a graph attention autoencoder model to perform spatial clustering for tissue segmentation using the selected features. We applied SmartGate to diverse IMS data at multicellular or subcellular spatial resolutions and compared it with four competing methods to demonstrate its effectiveness. SmartGate can significantly improve the accuracy of spatial segmentation and identify biomarker metabolites based on tissue structure–guided differential analysis. For multiple consecutive IMS data, SmartGate can effectively identify structures with spatial heterogeneity by introducing three-dimensional spatial neighbor information.

SONAR-MSI	Imaging MS		Yes	LC-MS has become an essential tool for the analysis of complex samples. However, conventional MS data processing often involves cumbersome workflows and is prone to loss of information, particularly in the context of chemically diverse natural products (NPs). In this study, a novel workflow termed SONAR-MSI was established by integrating synchronized selected ion acquisition (SONAR) with pseudo-mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) and deep learning (DL) for NP quality analysis. Specifically, to enable direct application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), a dedicated conversion protocol was established to transform SONAR-MS data into structured pseudoimages, while retaining comprehensive retention time, mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and intensity information. Comparative evaluation revealed that SONAR significantly reduces spectral redundancy and enhances MS2 quality while minimizing data storage demands relative to conventional MSE acquisition. As a case study, five closely related Ganoderma species were accurately classified using a SONAR-MSI-based CNN model, which achieved 100% accuracy, surpassing the performance of feature-table-based models (91.4%). Furthermore, the pixel-wise structure of SONAR-MSI allows interpretable mapping of metabolites to image coordinates, supporting both visualization and annotation. These findings establish SONAR-MSI as a robust and scalable approach for DL-assisted metabolomics, enabling efficient and information-rich NP analysis.

SpaceM	Imaging MS			A growing appreciation of the importance of cellular metabolism and revelations concerning the extent of cell–cell heterogeneity demand metabolic characterization of individual cells. We present SpaceM, an open-source method for in situ single-cell metabolomics that detects &gt;100 metabolites from &gt;1,000 individual cells per hour, together with a fluorescence-based readout and retention of morpho-spatial features. We validated SpaceM by predicting the cell types of cocultured human epithelial cells and mouse fibroblasts. We used SpaceM to show that stimulating human hepatocytes with fatty acids leads to the emergence of two coexisting subpopulations outlined by distinct cellular metabolic states. Inducing inflammation with the cytokine interleukin-17A perturbs the balance of these states in a process dependent on NF-κB signaling. The metabolic state markers were reproduced in a murine model of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis. We anticipate SpaceM to be broadly applicable for investigations of diverse cellular models and to democratize single-cell metabolomics. SpaceM combines light microscopy and MALDI-imaging mass spectrometry to enable single-cell metabolic profiling of cultured cells. SpaceM reveals coexisting metabolic states of hepatocytes and aims to democratize single-cell metabolomics.

SpatialMETA	Imaging MS			Simultaneous profiling of spatial transcriptomics (ST) and spatial metabolomics (SM) on the same or adjacent tissue sections offers a revolutionary approach to decode tissue microenvironment and identify potential therapeutic targets for cancer immunotherapy. Unlike other spatial omics, cross-modal integration of ST and SM data is challenging due to differences in feature distributions of transcript counts and metabolite intensities, and inherent disparities in spatial morphology and resolution. Furthermore, cross-sample integration is essential for capturing spatial consensus and heterogeneous patterns but is often complicated by batch effects. Here, we introduce SpatialMETA, a conditional variational autoencoder (CVAE)-based framework for cross-modal and cross-sample integration of ST and SM data. SpatialMETA employs tailored decoders and loss functions to enhance modality fusion, batch effect correction and biological conservation, enabling interpretable integration of spatially correlated ST-SM patterns and downstream analysis. SpatialMETA identifies immune spatial clusters with distinct metabolic features in cancer, revealing insights that extend beyond the original study. Compared to existing tools, SpatialMETA demonstrates superior reconstruction capability and fused modality representation, accurately capturing ST and SM feature distributions. In summary, SpatialMETA offers a powerful platform for advancing spatial multi-omics research and refining the understanding of metabolic heterogeneity within the tissue microenvironment.

SSN	Imaging MS			Unambiguous molecular annotations are essential to discern complex local biochemical processes in spatial biology. Here we present a scalable and broadly applicable platform for tandem mass spectrometry imaging (MS^2I) that overcomes current limitations in annotation with MSI by integrating Parallel Image Acquisition (PIA) with a novel open-access computational framework, Spatial Similarity Networking (SSN). The PIA employs parallelized acquisition of untargeted MSI and targeted MS^2I data using multiple inclusion lists to ensure spatially consistent and structure-resolved imaging of hundreds of molecular species in a single experiment. For molecular annotation, we have developed the SSN that complements PIA by leveraging spatial correlations among product ions through a graph-based analysis framework to enable confident molecular annotation even within highly complex MS^2I datasets. Using this integrated approach, we successfully resolved and annotated 134 phospholipid isomers and isobars from mouse brain tissue and suggest confidence levels for annotation for the MSI community. Furthermore, we applied our platform to interrogate cholesterol metabolism in human multiple sclerosis brain tissue, achieving annotation of six novel brain-related oxysterols and revealing spatially correlated oxidation pathways linked to lesion severity. Together, PIA and SSN establish a new framework for large-scale, structure-specific mass spectrometry imaging, with broad implications for spatial metabolomics, lipidomics, and chemical pathology beyond current capabilities.

subMALDI	Imaging MS			Mass spectrometry (MS) is an essential analytical technique used in many fields of science, including chemistry, biology, medicine, and more (Gross, 2011). Its uses are varied, from biotechnology studies of biomolecular sequencing (Maux et al., 2001), genetic analysis of human DNA (Null et al., 2001), exploration of the structure of single cells (Jones et al., 2003) and even examination of extraterrestrial objects (Fenselau & Caprioli, 2003). This incredible breadth of applications using MS results in highly complex data, which often requires significant processing in order to obtain actionable insights. Modern instrumentation often includes proprietary software for spectral processing and analysis (e.g. Bruker Daltonics’ Data Analysis). These tools, though convenient, often fail to provide sufficient documentation of the algorithms employed in the software and have limited analytical capabilities. Other commercial tools are available to supplement these programs (e.g. Agilent Technologies’ MassHunter Profinder and Thermo Scientific’s SIEVETM), however, they come at a cost. Open source software for analysis of MS data is also available online. These applications are often implemented in a variety of statistical computing languages, including Python (e.g. pyOpenMS) (Rost et al., 2014), Matlab (e.g. LIMPIC) (Mantini et al., 2007), C++ (e.g. ProteoWizard) (Chambers et al., 2012) and R (e.g. MSnbase, MALDIquant) (Gatto & Lilley, 2012; Gibb & Strimmer, 2012). While more accessible and well-documented than proprietary software, these available open source applications (Gibb, 2016) often utilize complex data structures (e.g. S3 and S4 class objects in R), which can make it difficult for researchers without strong coding backgrounds to access their raw spectral data. In order to simplify the organization and processing of mass spectrometry data, we propose the R package subMALDI. subMALDI is an open framework tool that permits organization, pre-processing (smoothing, baseline correction, peak detection), and normalization of spectral data sets without masking into S3 or S4 class objects. After every step of processing, the m/z and intensity data of each spectrum is readily accessible, providing researchers with a more thorough understanding of the data manipulation that occurs during analysis. As a result of the package’s open framework, subMALDI data sets are compatible with functions from a wide variety of other R packages, and user-defined functions are easier to implement and test.	subMALDI: an open framework R package for processing irregularly-spaced mass spectrometry data	https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.02694	Journal of Open Source Software	Yeh, K., Castel, S., Stock, N.

DeepION	Imaging MS		Yes	Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) is a high-throughput imaging technique capable of the qualitative and quantitative in situ detection of thousands of ions in biological samples. Ion image representation is a technique that produces a low-dimensional vector embedded with significant spectral and spatial information on an ion image, which further facilitates the distance-based similarity measurement for the identification of colocalized ions. However, given the low signal-to-noise ratios inherent in MSI data coupled with the scarcity of annotated data sets, achieving an effective ion image representation for each ion image remains a challenge. In this study, we propose DeepION, a novel deep learning-based method designed specifically for ion image representation, which is applied to the identification of colocalized ions and isotope ions. In DeepION, contrastive learning is introduced to ensure that the model can generate the ion image representation in a self-supervised manner without manual annotation. Since data augmentation is a crucial step in contrastive learning, a unique data augmentation strategy is designed by considering the characteristics of MSI data, such as the Poisson distribution of ion abundance and a random pattern of missing values, to generate plentiful ion image pairs for DeepION model training. Experimental results of rat brain tissue MSI show that DeepION outperforms other methods for both colocalized ion and isotope ion identification, demonstrating the effectiveness of ion image representation. The proposed model could serve as a crucial tool in the biomarker discovery and drug development of the MSI technique.

massNet	Imaging MS		Yes	Motivation Mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides rich biochemical information in a label-free manner and therefore holds promise to substantially impact current practice in disease diagnosis. However, the complex nature of MSI data poses computational challenges in its analysis. The complexity of the data arises from its large size, high-dimensionality and spectral nonlinearity. Preprocessing, including peak picking, has been used to reduce raw data complexity; however, peak picking is sensitive to parameter selection that, perhaps prematurely, shapes the downstream analysis for tissue classification and ensuing biological interpretation. Results We propose a deep learning model, massNet, that provides the desired qualities of scalability, nonlinearity and speed in MSI data analysis. This deep learning model was used, without prior preprocessing and peak picking, to classify MSI data from a mouse brain harboring a patient-derived tumor. The massNet architecture established automatically learning of predictive features, and automated methods were incorporated to identify peaks with potential for tumor delineation. The model’s performance was assessed using cross-validation, and the results demonstrate higher accuracy and a substantial gain in speed compared to the established classical machine learning method, support vector machine.

AllCCS2	Ion Mobility MS			The development of ion mobility–mass spectrometry (IM–MS) has revolutionized the analysis of small molecules, such as metabolomics, lipidomics, and exposome studies. The curation of comprehensive reference collision cross-section (CCS) databases plays a pivotal role in the successful application of IM–MS for small-molecule analysis. In this study, we presented AllCCS2, an enhanced version of AllCCS, designed for the universal prediction of the ion mobility CCS values of small molecules. AllCCS2 incorporated newly available experimental CCS data, including 10,384 records and 7713 unified values, as training data. By leveraging a neural network trained on diverse molecular representations encompassing mass spectrometry features, molecular descriptors, and graph features extracted using a graph convolutional network, AllCCS2 achieved exceptional prediction accuracy. AllCCS2 achieved median relative error (MedRE) values of 0.31, 0.72, and 1.64% in the training, validation, and testing sets, respectively, surpassing existing CCS prediction tools in terms of accuracy and coverage. Furthermore, AllCCS2 exhibited excellent compatibility with different instrument platforms (DTIMS, TWIMS, and TIMS). The prediction uncertainties in AllCCS2 from the training data and the prediction model were comprehensively investigated by using representative structure similarity and model prediction variation. Notably, small molecules with high structural similarities to the training set and lower model prediction variation exhibited improved accuracy and lower relative errors. In summary, AllCCS2 serves as a valuable resource to support applications of IM–MS technologies. The AllCCS2 database and tools are freely accessible at http://allccs.zhulab.cn/.

AutoCCS 	Ion Mobility MS			Ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) separations are increasingly used in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS) for separation and characterization of ionized molecular species. Information obtained from IMS measurements includes the ion’s collision cross section (CCS), which reflects its size and structure and constitutes a descriptor for distinguishing similar species in mixtures that cannot be separated using conventional approaches. Incorporating CCS into MS-based workflows can improve the specificity and confidence of molecular identification. At present, there is no automated, open-source pipeline for determining CCS of analyte ions in both targeted and untargeted fashion, and intensive user-assisted processing with vendor software and manual evaluation is often required. Results  We present AutoCCS, an open-source software to rapidly determine CCS values from IMS-MS measurements. We conducted various IMS experiments in different formats to demonstrate the flexibility of AutoCCS for automated CCS calculation: (i) stepped-field methods for drift tube-based IMS (DTIMS), (ii) single-field methods for DTIMS (supporting two calibration methods: a standard and a new enhanced method) and (iii) linear calibration for Bruker timsTOF and non-linear calibration methods for traveling wave based-IMS in Waters Synapt and Structures for Lossless Ion Manipulations. We demonstrated that AutoCCS offers an accurate and reproducible determination of CCS for both standard and unknown analyte ions in various IMS-MS platforms, IMS-field methods, ionization modes and collision gases, without requiring manual processing.

AutonoMS	Ion Mobility MS			Automation is dramatically changing the nature of laboratory life science. Robotic lab hardware that can perform manual operations with greater speed, endurance, and reproducibility opens an avenue for faster scientific discovery with less time spent on laborious repetitive tasks. A major bottleneck remains in integrating cutting-edge laboratory equipment into automated workflows, notably specialized analytical equipment, which is designed for human usage. Here we present AutonoMS, a platform for automatically running, processing, and analyzing high-throughput mass spectrometry experiments. AutonoMS is currently written around an ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) platform and can be adapted to additional analytical instruments and data processing flows. AutonoMS enables automated software agent-controlled end-to-end measurement and analysis runs from experimental specification files that can be produced by human users or upstream software processes. We demonstrate the use and abilities of AutonoMS in a high-throughput flow-injection ion mobility configuration with 5 s sample analysis time, processing robotically prepared chemical standards and cultured yeast samples in targeted and untargeted metabolomics applications. The platform exhibited consistency, reliability, and ease of use while eliminating the need for human intervention in the process of sample injection, data processing, and analysis. The platform paves the way toward a more fully automated mass spectrometry analysis and ultimately closed-loop laboratory workflows involving automated experimentation and analysis coupled to AI-driven experimentation utilizing cutting-edge analytical instrumentation.

CCS Predictor 2.0	Ion Mobility MS		Yes	Metabolite annotation continues to be the widely accepted bottleneck in nontargeted metabolomics workflows. Annotation of metabolites typically relies on a combination of high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS) with parent and tandem measurements, isotope cluster evaluations, and Kendrick mass defect (KMD) analysis. Chromatographic retention time matching with standards is often used at the later stages of the process, which can also be followed by metabolite isolation and structure confirmation utilizing nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The measurement of gas-phase collision cross-section (CCS) values by ion mobility (IM) spectrometry also adds an important dimension to this workflow by generating an additional molecular parameter that can be used for filtering unlikely structures. The millisecond timescale of IM spectrometry allows the rapid measurement of CCS values and allows easy pairing with existing MS workflows. Here, we report on a highly accurate machine learning algorithm (CCSP 2.0) in an open-source Jupyter Notebook format to predict CCS values based on linear support vector regression models. This tool allows customization of the training set to the needs of the user, enabling the production of models for new adducts or previously unexplored molecular classes. CCSP produces predictions with accuracy equal to or greater than existing machine learning approaches such as CCSbase, DeepCCS, and AllCCS, while being better aligned with FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles. Another unique aspect of CCSP 2.0 is its inclusion of a large library of 1613 molecular descriptors via the Mordred Python package, further encoding the fine aspects of isomeric molecular structures. CCS prediction accuracy was tested using CCS values in the McLean CCS Compendium with median relative errors of 1.25, 1.73, and 1.87% for the 170 [M – H]−, 155 [M + H]+, and 138 [M + Na]+ adducts tested. For superclass-matched data sets, CCS predictions via CCSP allowed filtering of 36.1% of incorrect structures while retaining a total of 100% of the correct annotations using a ΔCCS threshold of 2.8% and a mass error of 10 ppm.

CCSfind	Ion Mobility MS			Abstract In addition to providing critical knowledge of the accurate mass of ions, ion mobility‐mass spectrometry (IM‐MS) delivers complementary data relating to the conformation and size of ions in the form of an ion mobility spectrum and derived parameters, namely, the ion's mobility (K) and the IM‐derived collision cross section (CCS). However, the maximum amount of information obtained in IM‐MS measurements is not currently transferred into analytical databases including the full mobility spectra (CCS distributions) as well as capturing of additional ion species (e.g., adducts) into the same compound entry. We introduce CCSfind, a new tool for building comprehensive databases from experimental IM‐MS measurements of small molecules. CCSfind allows predicted ion species to be chosen for input chemical formulae, which are then targeted by CCSfind after parsing open source mzML input files to provide a unified set of results within a single data processing step. CCSfind can handle both chromatographically separated isomers and IM separation of isomeric ions (e.g., “protomers” or conformers of the same ion species) with simple user control over the output for new database entries in SQL format. Files of up to 1 GB can be processed in less than 2 min on a desktop computer with 32 GB RAM with computational time scaling linearly with the size of the input mzML file or the number of input molecular formulae. Results are manually reviewed, annotated with experimental settings, before committing the database where the full dataset can be retrieved.

DWSA-PSO	Ion Mobility MS			Despite the popularity of ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) for glycan analysis, its limited structural resolution hinders the effective separation of many glycan isomers. This leads to the overlap of IMS peaks, consequently impacting the accurate identification of glycan compositions. To this end, an improved algorithm, namely second-order differentiation combined with a simulated annealing particle swarm optimization algorithm based on sine adaptive weights (DWSA-PSO), was proposed for the separation of overlapping IMS peaks formed by glycan isomers. DWSA-PSO first performed second-order differentiation to automatically determine the number of components in overlapping peaks and exclude impossible single-peak combinations. It then introduced sinusoidal adaptive weights and a simulated annealing mechanism to improve the algorithm's search capability and global optimization performance, thereby enabling accurate and efficient separation of individual peaks. To evaluate the performance of DWSA-PSO and its application to the separation of glycan isomers, multiple sets of overlapping peaks with different degrees of overlap were simulated, and various types of multi-component overlapping peaks were formed using six disaccharide and four trisaccharide isomers. The experimental results consistently demonstrated that the DWSA-PSO algorithm outperformed both the improved particle swarm optimization (IPSO) algorithm and the dynamic inertia weight particle swarm optimization (DIWPSO) algorithm in terms of separation accuracy, running time, and fitness values. In addition, the DWSA-PSO algorithm was successfully applied to the separation of glycan isomers in malt milk beverage. All these results reveal the capability of the DWSA-PSO algorithm to facilitate the accurate identification of glycan isomers.

GCIMS	Ion Mobility MS			Gas-Chromatography coupled to Ion Mobility Spectrometry (GC-IMS) based metabolomics is an emerging technique for obtaining fast, reliable untargeted metabolic fingerprints of biofluids. The generated raw data is highly dimensional and complex, suffers from baseline problems, misalignments, long peak tails and strong non-linearities that must be corrected to extract chemically relevant features from samples. In this work, we present our GCIMS R package, which includes spectra loading, metadata handling, denoising, baseline correction, spectral and chromatographic alignment, peak detection, integration, and peak clustering to produce a peak table ready for multivariate data analysis. We discuss package design decisions, and, for illustration purposes, we show a case study of sex discrimination on the basis of the volatile compounds in urine samples. The GCIMS package provides a user-friendly workflow for non-code developers to process their raw data samples.

HyperCCS	Ion Mobility MS			Collision cross section (CCS) is a crucial parameter in ion mobility-mass spectrometry, which plays a significant role in enhancing the precision of compound annotation. Computational prediction methods aim to infer the CCS value from molecular structure and have become a common strategy for efficiently building large-scale CCS compound databases. However, most of the current available methods deliver suboptimal predictive performance due to limited high-quality training data sets and inadequate model architectures for handling multimodal features. To address these issues, we present HyperCCS, a novel CCS prediction framework powered by chemical large language models (CLLMs). Through fine-tuning a CLLM that has been trained on billions of SMILES sequences, HyperCCS effectively captures complex structural and chemical information that the current models trained on a limited CCS data set might miss. A cross-modal feature fusion module is designed to dynamically integrate CLLM-derived features with other heterogeneous features, effectively resolving structural ambiguities commonly found in multimodal features. Benchmark evaluation on the METLIN-CCS and AllCCS2 data sets shows that HyperCCS achieves robust CCS prediction on molecules of various masses, adduct types, and ion modes, outperforming other methods. To showcase the adaptability of HyperCCS within a real-world system, results on in-house experimental data demonstrate its ability to accurately resolve isomers and extrapolate to high-mass analytes. In addition, SHAP analysis and ablation studies confirm the crucial role of CLLM-derived features and the cross-modal feature fusion mechanism in enhancing CCS prediction. HyperCCS is anticipated to offer a high-throughput and cross-instrument computational tool to aid experimental efforts in metabolomics and structural biology.

Met4DX	Ion Mobility MS			Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) is a powerful tool in untargeted metabolomics, enabling the high-sensitivity and high-specificity characterization of metabolites. The integration of ion mobility (IM) with LC–MS, known as LC–IM–MS, enhances the analytical depth, facilitating more comprehensive metabolite profiling. However, the complexity of data generated by these technologies presents significant challenges in data processing. Addressing these challenges, we developed Met4DX, a unified and versatile software tool for processing both 3D and 4D untargeted metabolomics data. Met4DX incorporates a new MS1-oriented peak detection approach coupled with our bottom-up assembly algorithm, enabling highly sensitive and comprehensive peak detection in untargeted metabolomics data. Additionally, Met4DX employs a uniform quantification strategy to enhance the precision of peak integration across different samples. The software provides a user-friendly interface that simplifies data processing with default parameter sets, consolidating peak detection, alignment, quantification, and other procedures into a single streamlined workflow. Together, Met4DX offers a comprehensive solution for multidimensional metabolomics data processing, transforming raw data from diverse MS instruments into a final feature table containing quantification and identification results. We postulate Met4DX facilitates metabolite discovery in biological samples by deciphering the complex untargeted metabolomics data. Met4DX is freely available on the Internet (https://met4dx.zhulab.cn/).

MobiLipid	Ion Mobility MS			Ion mobility–mass spectrometry (IM-MS) offers benefits for lipidomics by obtaining IM-derived collision cross sections (CCS), a conditional property of an ion that can enhance lipid identification. While drift tube (DT) IM-MS retains a direct link to the primary experimental method to derive CCS values, other IM technologies rely solely on external CCS calibration, posing challenges due to dissimilar chemical properties between lipids and calibrants. To address this, we introduce MobiLipid, a novel tool facilitating the CCS quality control of IM-MS lipidomics workflows by internal standardization. MobiLipid utilizes a newly established DTCCSN2 library for uniformly (U)13C-labeled lipids, derived from a U13C-labeled yeast extract, containing 377 DTCCSN2 values. This automated open-source R Markdown tool enables internal monitoring and straightforward compensation for CCSN2 biases. It supports lipid class- and adduct-specific CCS corrections, requiring only three U13C-labeled lipids per lipid class-adduct combination across 10 lipid classes without requiring additional external measurements. The applicability of MobiLipid is demonstrated for trapped IM (TIM)-MS measurements of an unlabeled yeast extract spiked with U13C-labeled lipids. Monitoring the CCSN2 biases of TIMCCSN2 values compared to DTCCSN2 library entries utilizing MobiLipid resulted in mean absolute biases of 0.78% and 0.33% in positive and negative ionization mode, respectively. By applying the CCS correction integrated into the tool for the exemplary data set, the mean absolute CCSN2 biases of 10 lipid classes could be reduced to approximately 0%.

MOCCal	Ion Mobility MS			Ion mobility mass spectrometry (IM-MS) is a rapid, gas-phase separation technology that can resolve ions on the basis of their size-to-charge and mass-to-charge ratios. Since each class of biomolecule has a unique relationship between size and mass, IM-MS spectra of complex biological samples are organized into trendlines that each contain one type of biomolecule (i.e., lipid, peptide, metabolite). These trendlines can aid in the identification of unknown ions by providing a general classification, while more specific identifications require the conversion of IM arrival times to collision cross section (CCS) values to minimize instrument-to-instrument variability. However, the process of converting IM arrival times to CCS values varies between the different IM devices. Arrival times from traveling wave ion mobility (TWIM) devices must undergo a calibration process to obtain CCS values, which can impart biases if the calibrants are not structurally similar to the analytes. For multiomic mixtures, several different types of calibrants must be used to obtain the most accurate CCS values from TWIM platforms. Here we describe the development of a multiomic CCS calibration tool, MOCCal, to automate the assignment of unknown features to the power law calibration that provides the most accurate CCS value. MOCCal calibrates every experimental arrival time with up to three class-specific calibration curves and uses the difference (in Å2) between the calibrated TWCCSN2 value and DTCCSN2 vs m/z regression lines to determine the best calibration curve. Using real and simulated multiomic samples, we demonstrate that MOCCal provides accurately calibrated TWCCSN2 values for small molecules, lipids, and peptides.

Mol2CCS	Ion Mobility MS		Yes	Abstract Ion Mobility coupled with Mass Spectrometry (IM-MS) is a promising analytical technique that enhances molecular characterization by measuring collision cross-section (CCS) values, which are indicative of the molecular size and shape. However, the effective application of CCS values in structural analysis is still constrained by the limited availability of experimental data, necessitating the development of accurate machine learning (ML) models for in silico predictions. In this study, we evaluated state-of-the-art Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), trained to predict CCS values using the largest publicly available dataset to date. Although our results confirm the high accuracy of these models within chemical spaces similar to their training environments, their performance significantly declines when applied to structurally novel regions. This discrepancy raises concerns about the reliability of in silico CCS predictions and underscores the need for releasing further publicly available CCS datasets. To mitigate this, we introduce Mol2CCS which demonstrates how generalization can be partially improved by extending models to account for additional features such as molecular fingerprints, descriptors, and the molecule types. Lastly, we also show how confidence models can support by enhancing the reliability of the CCS estimates.Scientific contributionWe have benchmarked state-of-the-art graph neural networks for predicting collision cross section. Our work highlights the accuracy of these models when trained and predicted in similar chemical spaces, but also how their accuracy drops when evaluated in structurally novel regions. Lastly, we conclude by presenting potential approaches to mitigate this issue.

NA	Ion Mobility MS			Derivatization-enhanced multidimensional metabolomics combined with ion mobility mass spectrometry will greatly improve the accuracy and coverage of metabolic analysis. However, accurate prediction of the large-scale collision cross section (CCS) of derivatized metabolites without relying on standards and the establishment of multidimensional analytical methods faces great challenges. Here, we propose quantum chemistry calculation-assisted machine learning strategies applicable to the accurate prediction of the CCS of derivatized sterols, develop C═C bond-targeted N-Me derivatization methods for unsaturated sterols, and create a large-scale, 4D information database of derivatized sterol lipids (n = 4891) by combining retention time and fragment ion prediction. Furthermore, a high-coverage unsaturated sterolomics at the isomer level was established on this basis, which quantitatively revealed the tissue-specific distribution patterns of over 100 sterol lipids. This study provides a key foundation for derivatization-enhanced metabolomics and provides important techniques and information for metabolic and functional studies of sterols.

OpenTIMS, TimsPy, and TimsR	Ion Mobility MS			The Bruker timsTOF Pro is an instrument that couples trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS) to high-resolution time-of-flight (TOF) mass spectrometry (MS). For proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics applications, the instrument is typically interfaced with a liquid chromatography (LC) system. The resulting LC-TIMS-MS data sets are, in general, several gigabytes in size and are stored in the proprietary Bruker Tims data format (TDF). The raw data can be accessed using proprietary binaries in C, C++, and Python on Windows and Linux operating systems. Here we introduce a suite of computer programs for data accession, including OpenTIMS, TimsR, and TimsPy. OpenTIMS is a C++ library capable of reading Bruker TDF files. It opens up Bruker’s proprietary codebase. TimsPy and TimsR build on top of OpenTIMS, enabling swift and user-friendly data access to the raw data with Python and R. Both programs are available under a GPL3 license on all major platforms, extending the possibility to interact with timsTOF data to macOS. Additionally, OpenTIMS is capable of translating Bruker data into HDF5 files that can be easily analyzed from Python with the vaex module. OpenTIMS and TimsPy therefore provide easy and quick access to Bruker timsTOF raw data.

PACCS	Ion Mobility MS		Yes	Ion mobility spectrometry–mass spectrometry (IMS‐MS) enables rapid acquisition of collision cross section (CCS), a critical physicochemical property for analyte characterization. Despite CCS being theoretically defined as the rotationally averaged projected area of 3D atomic spheres, existing models have underutilized this geometric insight. Here, we present a projected area–based CCS prediction method (PACCS). It integrates voxel‐projected area approximation, graph neural network (GNN)–extracted features, and m/z to achieve accurate and rational CCS prediction. A voxel‐based algorithm efficiently calculates molecular projected areas by leveraging Fibonacci grids sampling and discretizing 3D conformers into voxel grids. PACCS demonstrates exceptional performance, achieving a median relative error (MedRE) of 1.03% and a coefficient of determination (R2) of 0.994 on the test set. External test set against AllCCS2, GraphCCS, SigmaCCS, CCSbase, and DeepCCS highlights the superiority of PACCS, with 80.1% of predictions exhibiting &lt; 3% error. Notably, PACCS exhibits broad applicability across diverse molecular types, including environmental contaminants (R2 = 0.954–0.979) and structurally complex phycotoxins (R2 = 0.961), highlighting the superiority of PACCS in robustness and versatility. Computational efficiency is enhanced via parallelization, enabling large‐scale CCS database generation (e.g., 5.9 million entries for ChEMBL within 10 h). Ablation studies confirm the pivotal role of voxel‐projected areas (Pearson correlation coefficients &gt; 0.988), while stability analyses reveal minimal sensitivity to conformational variability (standard deviation of R2 is 0.00003). PACCS provides an open‐source, scalable solution for expanding CCS databases, advancing compound identification in metabolomics and environmental analysis.

PNNL PreProcessor 	Ion Mobility MS			Ion mobility (IM) is often combined with LC-MS experiments to provide an additional dimension of separation for complex sample analysis. While highly complex samples are better characterized by the full dimensionality of LC-IM-MS experiments to uncover new information, downstream data analysis workflows are often not equipped to properly mine the additional IM dimension. For many samples the data acquisition benefits of including IM separations are all that is necessary to uncover sample information and the full dimensionality of the data is not required for data analysis. Postacquisition reduction and adaptation of the dimensions of LC-IM-MS and IM-MS experiments into an LC-MS format opens the possibility to use a plethora of existing software tools. In this work, we developed data file conversion tools to reduce the complexity of IM data analysis. Three data file transformations are introduced in the PNNL PreProcessor software: (1) mapping the IM axis to the LC axis for IM-MS data, (2) converting the drift time vs m/z space to CCS/z vs m/z space, and (3) transforming All Ions IM/MS mobility aligned fragmentation data to a standard LC-MS DDA data file format. These new data file conversions are demonstrated with corresponding lipidomics and proteomics workflows that leverage existing LC-MS data analysis software to highlight the benefits of the data transformations.

POMICS	Ion Mobility MS			The interpretation of ion mobility coupled to mass spectrometry (IM-MS) data to predict unknown structures is challenging and depends on accurate theoretical estimates of the molecular ion collision cross section (CCS) against a buffer gas in a low or atmospheric pressure drift chamber. The sensitivity and reliability of computational prediction of CCS values depend on accurately modeling the molecular state over accessible conformations. In this work, we developed an efficient CCS computational workflow using a machine learning model in conjunction with standard DFT methods and CCS calculations. Furthermore, we have performed Traveling Wave IM-MS (TWIMS) experiments to validate the extant experimental values and assess uncertainties in experimentally measured CCS values. The developed workflow yielded accurate structural predictions and provides unique insights into the likely preferred conformation analyzed using IM-MS experiments. The complete workflow makes the computation of CCS values tractable for a large number of conformationally flexible metabolites with complex molecular structures.

PubChemLite plus CCS	Ion Mobility MS			Finding relevant chemicals in the vast (known) chemical space is a major challenge for environmental and exposomics studies leveraging non-target high resolution mass spectrometry (NT-HRMS) methods. Chemical databases now contain hundreds of millions of chemicals, yet many are not relevant. This article details an extensive collaborative, open science effort to provide a dynamic collection of chemicals for environmental, metabolomics and exposomics research, along with supporting information about their relevance to assist researchers in the interpretation of candidate hits. The PubChemLite for Exposomics collection is compiled from ten annotation categories within PubChem, enhanced with patent, literature and annotation counts, predicted partition coefficient (logP) values, as well as predicted collision cross section (CCS) values using CCSbase. Monthly versions are archived on Zenodo under a CC-BY license, supporting reproducible research, and a new interface has been developed, including the chemical stripes on patent and literature data, for researchers to browse the collection. This article further describes how PubChemLite can support researchers in environmental/exposomics studies, describes efforts to increase the availability of experimental CCS values, and explores known limitations and potential for future developments. The data and code behind these efforts are openly available. PubChemLite content can be explored at https://pubchemlite.lcsb.uni.lu.

SigmaCCS	Ion Mobility MS			The collision cross section (CCS) values derived from ion mobility spectrometry can be used to improve the accuracy of compound identification. Here, we have developed the Structure included graph merging with adduct method for CCS prediction (SigmaCCS) based on graph neural networks using 3D conformers as inputs. A model was trained, evaluated, and tested with &gt;5,000 experimental CCS values. It achieved a coefficient of determination of 0.9945 and a median relative error of 1.1751% on the test set. The model-agnostic interpretation method and the visualization of the learned representations were used to investigate the chemical rationality of SigmaCCS. An in-silico database with 282 million CCS values was generated for three different adduct types of 94 million compounds. Its source code is publicly available at https://github.com/zmzhang/SigmaCCS . Altogether, SigmaCCS is an accurate, rational, and off-the-shelf method to directly predict CCS values from molecular structures. The collision cross section (CCS) values derived from ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) are a significant molecular property used for compound identification, however, accurate CCS prediction from molecular structure remains challenging. Here, the authors develop an accurate SigmaCCS approach based on graph neural networks using 3D conformers generated from SMILES strings to directly predict CCS values from molecular structures.

Snakemake CCS	Ion Mobility MS			We implemented an ab initio CCS prediction workflow which incrementally refines generated structures using molecular mechanics, a deep learning potential, conformational clustering, and quantum mechanics (QM). Automating intermediate steps for a high performance computing (HPC) environment allows users to input the SMILES structure of small organic molecules and obtain a Boltzmann averaged collisional cross section (CCS) value as output. The CCS of a molecular species is a metric measured by ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) which can improve annotation of untargeted metabolomics experiments. We report only a minor drop in accuracy when we expedite the CCS calculation by replacing the QM geometry refinement step with a single-point energy calculation. Even though the workflow involves stochastic steps (i.e., conformation generation and clustering), the final CCS value was highly reproducible for multiple iterations on L-carnosine. Finally, we illustrate that the gas phase ensembles modeled for the workflow are intermediate files which can be used for the prediction of other properties such as aqueous phase nuclear magnetic resonance chemical shift prediction. The software is available at the following link: https://github.com/DasSusanta/snakemake_ccs.

SSN-CCSPIF	Ion Mobility MS			Ion mobility coupled with mass spectrometry (IM-MS), an emerging technology for analysis of complex matrix, has been facing challenges due to the complexities of chemical structures and original data, as well as low-efficiency and error-proneness of manual operations. In this study, we developed a structural similarity networking assisted collision cross-section prediction interval filtering (SSN-CCSPIF) strategy. We first carried out a structural similarity networking (SSN) based on Tanimoto similarities among Morgan fingerprints to classify the authentic compounds potentially existing in complex matrix. By performing automatic regressive prediction statistics on mass-to-charge ratios (m/z) and collision cross-sections (CCS) with a self-built Python software, we explored the IM-MS feature trendlines, established filtering intervals and filtered potential compounds for each SSN classification. Chemical structures of all filtered compounds were further characterized by interpreting their multidimensional IM-MS data. To evaluate the applicability of SSN-CCSPIF, we selected Ginkgo biloba extract and dripping pills. The SSN-CCSPIF subtracted more background interferences (43.24%∼43.92%) than other similar strategies with conventional ClassyFire criteria (10.71%∼12.13%) or without compound classification (35.73%∼36.63%). Totally, 229 compounds, including eight potential new compounds, were characterized. Among them, seven isomeric pairs were discriminated with the integration of IM-separation. Using SSN-CCSPIF, we can achieve high-efficient analysis of complex IM-MS data and comprehensive chemical profiling of complex matrix to reveal their material basis.

Chemprop-IR	IR		Yes	Infrared (IR) spectroscopy remains an important tool for chemical characterization and identification. Chemprop-IR has been developed as a software package for the prediction of IR spectra through the use of machine learning. This work serves the dual purpose of providing a trained general-purpose model for the prediction of IR spectra with ease and providing the Chemprop-IR software framework for the training of new models. In Chemprop-IR, molecules are encoded using a directed message passing neural network, allowing for molecule latent representations to be learned and optimized for the task of spectral predictions. Model training incorporates spectra metrics and normalization techniques that offer better performance with spectral predictions than standard practice in regression models. The model makes use of pretraining using quantum chemistry calculations and ensembling of multiple submodels to improve generalizability and performance. The spectral predictions that result are of high quality, showing capability to capture the extreme diversity of spectral forms over chemical space and represent complex peak structures.

Graphormer-IR	IR		Yes	Infrared (IR) spectroscopy is an important analytical tool in various chemical and forensic domains and a great deal of effort has gone into developing in silico methods for predicting experimental spectra. A key challenge in this regard is generating highly accurate spectra quickly to enable real-time feedback between computation and experiment. Here, we employ Graphormer, a graph neural network (GNN) transformer, to predict IR spectra using only simplified molecular-input line-entry system (SMILES) strings. Our data set includes 53,528 high-quality spectra, measured in five different experimental media (i.e., phases), for molecules containing the elements H, C, N, O, F, Si, S, P, Cl, Br, and I. When using only atomic numbers for node encodings, Graphormer-IR achieved a mean test spectral information similarity (SISμ) value of 0.8449 ± 0.0012 (n = 5), which surpasses that the current state-of-the-art model Chemprop-IR (SISμ = 0.8409 ± 0.0014, n = 5) with only 36% of the encoded information. Augmenting node embeddings with additional node-level descriptors in learned embeddings generated through a multilayer perceptron improves scores to SISμ = 0.8523 ± 0.0006, a total improvement of 19.7σ (t = 19). These improved scores show how Graphormer-IR excels in capturing long-range interactions like hydrogen bonding, anharmonic peak positions in experimental spectra, and stretching frequencies of uncommon functional groups. Scaling our architecture to 210 attention heads demonstrates specialist-like behavior for distinct IR frequencies that improves model performance. Our model utilizes novel architectures, including a global node for phase encoding, learned node feature embeddings, and a one-dimensional (1D) smoothing convolutional neural network (CNN). Graphormer-IR’s innovations underscore its value over traditional message-passing neural networks (MPNNs) due to its expressive embeddings and ability to capture long-range intramolecular relationships.

Spectro	IR/NMR/Annotation			Molecular structure elucidation is a crucial but fundamentally challenging step in the characterization of materials given the large number of possible structures. Here, we introduce Spectro, an innovative multi-modal approach for molecular elucidation that combines and NMR data with IR. Spectro translates the embedded representations of the spectra into molecular structures using the SELFIES notation. We employed a vision model for the embedded representation of the IR data, which was pretrained to detect relevant functional group peaks in the IR spectra achieving an F1 score of 91%. For NMR data, we utilized LLM2Vec, treating the NMR spectra as text. This integration of multiple spectroscopic techniques allows Spectro to achieve an overall test accuracy of 93% when trained jointly with the vision model for the IR spectra, and 82% when trained with fixed embeddings. Our approach demonstrates the potential of multi-modal learning in tackling complex molecular characterization tasks.

Aerith	Isotopic			Stable isotope probing (SIP) traces the metabolism of biological cells using isotopically heavy substrates (e.g., 13C, 15N, or 2H). Confident identification of the metabolic products of isotopic labeling remains a challenge due to the difficulties in simulating, visualizing and annotating the isotopic patterns of partially labeled peptides and metabolites found in mass spectrometry (MS) data. Here, we present Aerith, an R package designed to visualize data of simulated and observed isotopic envelopes of peptides and metabolites with user-defined formula and atom % enrichment levels. Aerith models the isotopic distributions of the fragment ion series of a peptide by sequentially convoluting isotopic envelopes of monomeric units using a convolution algorithm. Aerith simulates fine isotopic structures of a compound using Monte Carlo simulation via the multinomial distribution, and calculates the isotopic envelopes of metabolites with known chemical formulas using an FFT-based algorithm. These algorithms provide accurate simulation of the isotopic envelopes of SIP-labeled peptides and metabolites with high computational efficiency. Aerith evaluates peptide-spectrum matches through multiple robust and commonly used scoring functions to compare experimental and theoretical spectra. These algorithms were implemented in C++ and accessed in R via Rcpp to ensure real-time interactivity and significantly improve computational efficiency compared to native R code. We present case studies to demonstrate Aerith's utility in resolving isotopic fine structures and envelopes for glucose, penicillin, and microbial peptides containing natural and enriched isotopes. By providing visualization of isotopically labeled peptides and metabolites, Aerith enables precise annotation of their mass spectra and manual validation of their identifications in proteomic and metabolomic SIP studies.

CIL-ExPMRM	Isotopic			Exposome is the future of next-generation environmental health to establish the association between environmental exposure and diseases. However, due to low concentrations of exposure chemicals, exposome has been hampered by lacking an effective analytical platform to characterize its composition. In this study, by combining the benefit of chemical isotope labeling and pseudo-multiple reaction monitoring (CIL-pseudo-MRM), we have developed one highly sensitive and high-throughput platform (CIL-ExPMRM) by isotope labeling urinary exposure biomarkers. Dansyl chloride (DnsCl), N-methylphenylethylamine (MPEA), and their isotope-labeled forms were used to derivatize polar hydroxyl and carboxyl compounds, respectively. We have programmed a series of scripts to optimize MRM transition parameters, curate the MRM database (>70,000 compounds), predict accurate retention time (RT), and automize dynamic MRMs. This was followed by an automated MRM peak assignment, peak alignment, and statistical analysis. A computational pipeline was eventually incorporated into a user-friendly website interface, named CIL-ExPMRM (http://www.exposomemrm.com/). The performance of this platform has been validated with a relatively low false positive rate (10.7%) across instrumental platforms. CIL-ExPMRM has systematically overcome key bottlenecks of exposome studies to some extent and outperforms previous methods due to its independence of MS/MS availability, accurate RT prediction, and collision energy optimization, as well as the ultrasensitivity and automated robust intensity-based quantification. Overall, CIL-ExPMRM has great potential to advance the exposomic studies based on urinary biomarkers.

FAMetA	Isotopic			The use of stable isotope tracers and mass spectrometry (MS) is the gold standard method for the analysis of fatty acid (FA) metabolism. Yet, current state-of-the-art tools provide limited and difficult-to-interpret information about FA biosynthetic routes. Here we present FAMetA, an R package and a web-based application (www.fameta.es) that uses 13C mass isotopologue profiles to estimate FA import, de novo lipogenesis, elongation and desaturation in a user-friendly platform. The FAMetA workflow covers the required functionalities needed for MS data analyses. To illustrate its utility, different in vitro and in vivo experimental settings are used in which FA metabolism is modified. Thanks to the comprehensive characterization of FA biosynthesis and the easy-to-interpret graphical representations compared to previous tools, FAMetA discloses unnoticed insights into how cells reprogram their FA metabolism and, when combined with FASN, SCD1 and FADS2 inhibitors, it enables the identification of new FAs by the metabolic reconstruction of their synthesis route.

isopair	Isotopic			Untargeted metabolomics enables direct quantification of metabolites without apriori knowledge of their identity. Liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS), a popular method to implement untargeted metabolomics, identifies metabolites via combined mass/charge (m/z) and retention time as mass features. Improvements in the sensitivity of mass spectrometers has increased the complexity of data produced, leading to computational obstacles. One outstanding challenge is calling metabolite mass feature peaks rapidly and accurately in large LC-MS datasets (dozens to thousands of samples) in the presence of measurement and other noise. While existing algorithms are useful, they have limitations that become pronounced at scale and lead to false positive metabolite predictions as well as signal dropouts. To overcome some of these shortcomings, biochemists have developed hybrid computational and carbon labeling techniques, such as credentialing. Credentialing can validate metabolite signals, but is laborious and its applicability is limited. We have developed a suite of three computational tools to overcome the challenges of unreliable algorithms and inefficient validation protocols: isolock, autoCredential and anovAlign. Isolock uses isopairs, or metabolite-istopologue pairs, to calculate and correct for mass drift noise across LC-MS runs. autoCredential leverages statistical features of LC-MS data to amplify naturally present 13C isotopologues and validate metabolites through isopairs. This obviates the need to artificially introduce carbon labeling. anovAlign, an anova-derived algorithm, is used to align retention time windows across samples to accurately delineate retention time windows for mass features. Using a large published clinical dataset as well as a plant dataset with biological replicates across time, genotype and treatment, we demonstrate that this suite of tools is more sensitive and reproducible than both an open source metabolomics pipelines, XCMS, and the commercial software progenesis QI. This software suite opens a new era for enhanced accuracy and increased throughput for untargeted metabolomics.

IsoPairFinder	Isotopic			Summary The functional annotation of microbial genes lags far behind genome sequencing, leaving critical gaps in our knowledge of metabolic pathways. While integrating genetic manipulation with stable isotope tracing (SIT) metabolomics holds promise for pathway discovery, existing tools lack specialized capabilities for gene perturbation experiments. To address this need, we developed IsoPairFinder, a computational tool that identifies pathway intermediates by analyzing paired unlabeled (12C) and isotope-labeled (13C) metabolomics data from gene-edited microbes. By prioritizing substrate-specific feature pairs, IsoPairFinder efficiently prioritizes biologically relevant intermediates. Implemented as an open-source R package and integrated into the GNPS2 ecosystem, IsoPairFinder provides an accessible platform for the research community to accelerate novel pathway discovery and validation.  Availability and implementation IsoPairFinder is freely available as an open-source R package (https://github.com/DoddLab/IsoPairFinder) and as a web-based workflow in the GNPS2 ecosystem (https://gnps2.org/workflowinput?workflowname=isopairfinder_nextflow_workflow). Comprehensive tutorials are provided at https://doddlab.github.io/IsoPairFinder_Tutorials. These implementations support both command-line and graphical analysis workflows.

Isoreader	Isotopic			The measurement and interpretation of the stable isotope composition of any material or molecule has widespread application in disciplines ranging from the earth sciences to ecology, anthropology, and forensics. The naturally occurring differences in the abundance of the sta- ble isotopes of carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and many other elements provide valuable insight into environmental conditions and sources, fluxes, and mechanisms of material transfer. Be- cause isotopic variations in nature are very small, the measurement itself requires cutting edge analytical instrumentation using isotope ratio mass spectrometry (IRMS) as well as rigorous data reduction procedures for calibration and quality control. The isoreader package im- plements an easily extendable interface for IRMS data from common instrument vendor file formats and thus enables the reading and processing of stable isotope data directly from the source. This provides a foundational tool for platform-independent, efficient and reproducible data reduction.

IsoSolve	Isotopic			Stable-isotope labeling experiments are widely used to investigate the topology and functioning of metabolic networks. Label incorporation into metabolites can be quantified using a broad range of mass spectrometry (MS)and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)spectroscopy methods, but in general, no single approach can completely cover isotopic space, even for small metabolites. The number of quantifiable isotopic species could be increased, and the coverage of isotopic space improved, by integrating measurements obtained by different methods; however, this approach has remained largely unexplored because no framework able to deal with partial, heterogeneous isotopic measurements has yet been developed. Here, we present a generic computational framework based on symbolic calculus that can integrate any isotopic dataset by connecting measurements to the chemical structure of the molecules. As a test case, we apply this framework to isotopic analyses of amino acids, which are ubiquitous to life, central to many biological questions, and can be analyzed by a broad range of MS and NMR methods. We demonstrate how this integrative framework helps to i) clarify and improve the coverage of isotopic space, ii) evaluate the complementarity and redundancy of different techniques, iii) consolidate isotopic datasets, iv) design experiments, and v) guide future analytical developments. This framework, which can be applied to any labeled element, isotopic tracer, metabolite, and analytical platform, has been implemented in IsoSolve (available at https://github.com/MetaSysLISBP/IsoSolve and https://pypi.org/project/IsoSolve), an open source software that can be readily integrated into data analysis pipelines.

khipu	Isotopic			In untargeted metabolomics, multiple ions are often measured for each original metabolite, including isotopic forms and in-source modifications, such as adducts and fragments. Without prior knowledge of the chemical identity or formula, computational organization and interpretation of these ions is challenging, which is the deficit of previous software tools that perform the task using network algorithms. We propose here a generalized tree structure to annotate ions in relationships to the original compound and infer neutral mass. An algorithm is presented to convert mass distance networks to this tree structure with high fidelity. This method is useful for both regular untargeted metabolomics and stable isotope tracing experiments. It is implemented as a Python package (khipu) and provides a JSON format for easy data exchange and software interoperability. By generalized preannotation, khipu makes it feasible to connect metabolomics data with common data science tools and supports flexible experimental designs.

Khipu-web	Isotopic			Stable isotope tracing is a crucial technique for understanding the metabolic wiring of biological systems, determining metabolic flux through pathways of interest, and detecting novel metabolites and pathways. Despite the potential insights provided by this technique, its application remains limited to a small number of targeted molecules and pathways. Because previous software tools usually require chemical formulas to find relevant features, and the data are highly complex, especially in untargeted metabolomics and when the downstream reactions and metabolites are poorly characterized. We report here Khipu version 2 and its new user-friendly web application. New functions are added to enhance analyzing stable isotope tracing data including metrics that evaluate peak enrichment in labeled samples, scoring methods to facilitate robust detection of intensity patterns and integrated natural abundance correction. We demonstrate that this approach can be applied to untargeted metabolomics to systematically extract isotope-labeled compounds and annotate the unidentified metabolites.

SIMPEL	Isotopic			The capacity to leverage high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) with transient isotope labeling experiments is an untapped opportunity to derive insights on context-specific metabolism, that is difficult to assess quantitatively. Tools are needed to comprehensively mine isotopologue information in an automated, high-throughput way without errors. We describe a tool, Stable Isotope-assisted Metabolomics for Pathway Elucidation (SIMPEL), to simplify analysis and interpretation of isotope-enriched HRMS datasets. The efficacy of SIMPEL is demonstrated through examples of central carbon and lipid metabolism. In the first description, a dual-isotope labeling experiment is paired with SIMPEL and isotopically nonstationary metabolic flux analysis (INST-MFA) to resolve fluxes in central metabolism that would be otherwise challenging to quantify. In the second example, SIMPEL was paired with HRMS-based lipidomics data to describe lipid metabolism based on a single labeling experiment. Available as an R package, SIMPEL extends metabolomics analyses to include isotopologue signatures necessary to quantify metabolic flux.

LargeMetabo	Large scale			Large-scale metabolomics is a powerful technique that has attracted widespread attention in biomedical studies focused on identifying biomarkers and interpreting the mechanisms of complex diseases. Despite a rapid increase in the number of large-scale metabolomic studies, the analysis of metabolomic data remains a key challenge. Specifically, diverse unwanted variations and batch effects in processing many samples have a substantial impact on identifying true biological markers, and it is a daunting challenge to annotate a plethora of peaks as metabolites in untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics. Therefore, the development of an out-of-the-box tool is urgently needed to realize data integration and to accurately annotate metabolites with enhanced functions. In this study, the LargeMetabo package based on R code was developed for processing and analyzing large-scale metabolomic data. This package is unique because it is capable of (1) integrating multiple analytical experiments to effectively boost the power of statistical analysis; (2) selecting the appropriate biomarker identification method by intelligent assessment for large-scale metabolic data and (3) providing metabolite annotation and enrichment analysis based on an enhanced metabolite database. The LargeMetabo package can facilitate flexibility and reproducibility in large-scale metabolomics. The package is freely available from https://github.com/LargeMetabo/LargeMetabo.

BATL	Lipidomics			Motivation Bioinformatic tools capable of annotating, rapidly and reproducibly, large, targeted lipidomic datasets are limited. Specifically, few programs enable high-throughput peak assessment of liquid chromatography–electrospray ionization tandem mass spectrometry data acquired in either selected or multiple reaction monitoring modes. Results  We present here Bayesian Annotations for Targeted Lipidomics, a Gaussian naïve Bayes classifier for targeted lipidomics that annotates peak identities according to eight features related to retention time, intensity, and peak shape. Lipid identification is achieved by modeling distributions of these eight input features across biological conditions and maximizing the joint posterior probabilities of all peak identities at a given transition. When applied to sphingolipid and glycerophosphocholine selected reaction monitoring datasets, we demonstrate over 95% of all peaks are rapidly and correctly identified.

DIATAGe	Lipidomics			Abstract Background Triacylglycerols (TGs) are the most abundant lipids in the human body and the primary source of energy storage. TGs are comprised of three fatty acyls with various lengths and double bond composition, complicating structural annotation when performing lipidomics by LCMS. Data-independent acquisition (DIA) based lipidomics enables a continuous and unbiased acquisition of all TGs, creating the potential for more comprehensive TG analysis. However, TG identification in DIA lipidomics data is challenging due to the difficulty analyzing multiplexed tandem mass spectra (MS2). Results In this study, we present DIATAGeR, an R package aimed to improve and automate TG identifications to the molecular species level in DIA-based lipidomics. With DIATAGeR, TGs are identified using a TG-centric approach, where each TG in the reference database is considered as an analysis target, searched in DIA spectra, and scored using a logistic regression machine learning algorithm. Additionally, DIATAGeR uses a false discovery rate (FDR) correction calculated by a target-decoy approach to improve the confidence of TG identification and limit false positives due to interference from unrelated ions. The performance of DIATAGeR was validated in a lipidomic study of liver and plasma samples from mice with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) and healthy controls. All 9 TG standards were annotated at an FDR <0.1 in both datasets. When benchmarked against MS-DIAL, TGs identified by DIATAGeR contained 18 % and 12 % more even-carbon fatty acyls in liver and plasma datasets, respectively. Significance DIATAGeR is a valuable tool for streamlining complex TG annotation in DIA-lipidomics data. It supports vendor-neutral MS spectra data formats and offers a customizable reference database. By combining TG-centric and target-decoy approaches, DIATAGeR showed improvements in TG identification by addressing primary challenges associated with multiplexed MS2 spectra.

Doxlipid	Lipidomics			Nontargeted lipidomics using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry can detect thousands of molecules in biological samples. However, the annotation of unknown oxidized lipids is limited to the structures present in libraries, restricting the analysis and interpretation of experimental data. Here, we describe Doxlipid, a computational tool for oxidized lipid annotation that predicts a dynamic MS/MS library for every experiment. Doxlipid integrates three key simulation algorithms to predict libraries and covers 32 subclasses of oxidized lipids from the three main classes. In the evaluation, Doxlipid achieves very high prediction and characterization performance and outperforms the current oxidized lipid annotation methods. Doxlipid, combined with a molecular network, further annotates unknown chemical analogs in the same reaction or pathway. We demonstrate the broad utility of Doxlipid by analyzing oxidized lipids in ferroptosis hepatocellular carcinoma, tissue samples, and other biological samples, substantially advancing the discovery of biological pathways at the trace oxidized lipid level.

LINEX2⁠	Lipidomics			Lipidomics is of growing importance for clinical and biomedical research due to many associations between lipid metabolism and diseases. The discovery of these associations is facilitated by improved lipid identification and quantification. Sophisticated computational methods are advantageous for interpreting such large-scale data for understanding metabolic processes and their underlying (patho)mechanisms. To generate hypothesis about these mechanisms, the combination of metabolic networks and graph algorithms is a powerful option to pinpoint molecular disease drivers and their interactions. Here we present lipid network explorer (LINEX⁠), a lipid network analysis framework that fuels biological interpretation of alterations in lipid compositions. By integrating lipid-metabolic reactions from public databases, we generate dataset-specific lipid interaction networks. To aid interpretation of these networks, we present an enrichment graph algorithm that infers changes in enzymatic activity in the context of their multispecificity from lipidomics data. Our inference method successfully recovered the MBOAT7 enzyme from knock-out data. Furthermore, we mechanistically interpret lipidomic alterations of adipocytes in obesity by leveraging network enrichment and lipid moieties. We address the general lack of lipidomics data mining options to elucidate potential disease mechanisms and make lipidomics more clinically relevant.

LIPID MAPS	Lipidomics			LIPID MAPS (LIPID Metabolites and Pathways Strategy), www.lipidmaps.org, provides a systematic and standardized approach to organizing lipid structural and biochemical data. Founded 20 years ago, the LIPID MAPS nomenclature and classification has become the accepted community standard. LIPID MAPS provides databases for cataloging and identifying lipids at varying levels of characterization in addition to numerous software tools and educational resources, and became an ELIXIR-UK data resource in 2020. This paper describes the expansion of existing databases in LIPID MAPS, including richer metadata with literature provenance, taxonomic data and improved interoperability to facilitate FAIR compliance. A joint project funded by ELIXIR-UK, in collaboration with WikiPathways, curates and hosts pathway data, and annotates lipids in the context of their biochemical pathways. Updated features of the search infrastructure are described along with implementation of programmatic access via API and SPARQL. New lipid-specific databases have been developed and provision of lipidomics tools to the community has been updated. Training and engagement have been expanded with webinars, podcasts and an online training school.

Lipid Spectrum Generator	Lipidomics			Due to the complexity of lipids in nature, the use of in silico generated spectral libraries to identify lipid species from mass spectral data has become an integral part of many lipidomic workflows. However, many in silico libraries are either limited in usability or their capacity to represent lipid species. Here, we introduce Lipid Spectrum Generator, an open-source in silico spectral library generator specifically designed to aid in the identification of lipids in liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry analysis.

Lipid Wizard	Lipidomics			Lipids play a significant role in life activities and participate in the biological system through different pathways. Although comprehensive two-dimensional liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (2DLC-MS) has been developed to profile lipid abundance changes, lipid identification and quantification from 2DLC-MS data remain a challenge. We created Lipid Wizard, open-source software for lipid assignment and isotopic peak stripping of the 2DLC-MS data. Lipid Wizard takes the peak list deconvoluted from the 2DLC-MS data as input and assigns each isotopic peak to the lipids recorded in the LIPID MAPS database by precursor ion m/z matching. The matched lipids are then filtered by the first-dimension retention time (1D RT), followed by the second-dimension retention time (2D RT), where the 2D RT of each lipid is predicted using an equivalent carbon number (ECN) model. The remaining assigned lipids are used for isotopic peak stripping via an iterative linear regression. The performance of Lipid Wizard was tested using a set of lipid standards and then applied to study the lipid changes in the livers of mice (fat-1) fed with alcohol.

LipidA-IDER	Lipidomics			With the global emergence of drug-resistant bacteria causing difficult-to-treat infections, there is an urgent need for a tool to facilitate studies on key virulence and antimicrobial resistant factors. Mass spectrometry (MS) has contributed substantially to the elucidation of the structure-function relationships of lipid A, the endotoxic component of lipopolysaccharide which also serves as an important protective barrier against antimicrobials. Here, we present LipidA-IDER, an automated structure annotation tool for system-level scale identification of lipid A from high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) data. LipidA-IDER was validated against previously reported structures of lipid A in the reference bacteria, Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Using MS2 data of variable quality, we demonstrated LipidA-IDER annotated lipid A with a performance of 71.2% specificity and 70.9% sensitivity, offering greater accuracy than existing lipidomics software. The organism-independent workflow was further applied to a panel of six bacterial species: E. coli and Gram-negative members of ESKAPE pathogens. A comprehensive atlas comprising 188 distinct lipid A species, including remodeling intermediates, was generated and can be integrated with software including MS-DIAL and Metabokit for identification and semiquantitation. Systematic comparison of a pair of polymyxin-sensitive and polymyxin-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii isolated from a human patient unraveled multiple key lipid A structural features of polymyxin resistance within a single analysis. Probing the lipid A landscape of bacteria using LipidA-IDER thus holds immense potential for advancing our understanding of the vast diversity and structural complexity of a key lipid virulence and antimicrobial-resistant factor.

LipidCruncher	Lipidomics			Advances in mass spectrometry (MS)-based lipidomics have led to a surge in data volume, underscoring a need for robust tools to evaluate and visualize these data comprehensively. Current workflows are often hampered by manual spreadsheet handling and insufficient assessment of data quality prior to analysis. Here, we introduce LipidCruncher, an open-source, web-based platform designed to process, visualize, and analyze lipidomic data with high efficiency and rigor. LipidCruncher consolidates key steps of the workflow, including data standardization, normalization, and stringent quality control to identify anomalies. The platform also provides advanced visualization and analysis tools, such as volcano plots, lipid saturation profiles, pathway mapping, and lipid heatmaps, that enable detailed and holistic data exploration. To demonstrate LipidCruncher's utility, we analyzed lipidomic data from adipose tissue of mice lacking the triacylglycerol synthesis enzymes DGAT1 and DGAT2. We anticipate that LipidCruncher will be a valuable and user-friendly tool for standardizing and analyzing lipidomics data.

Lipidepifind	Lipidomics			Lipidomics enables comprehensive profiling of lipid species, providing a powerful approach for studying disease pathogenesis and identifying biomarkers. Conventional lipidomics workflows rely on the annotation of lipid species using curated biochemical databases. However, many unidentified lipids are absent from these databases, which limits the discovery of functional or pathological biomarkers. To address this limitation, we developed a method to systematically identify structurally modified lipids, referred to as epi-metabolites, in biological samples. First, 1479 parent lipids were identified across different biological matrices using liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry. Next, the MS characteristics of all potential lipid epi-metabolites were predicted using a metabolic network expansion strategy comprising 62 reaction types and were subsequently screened in raw test sample data. To ensure reproducibility and improve analytical efficiency, we implemented this workflow in a user-friendly Shiny app (https://xinguang-liu.shinyapps.io/metabolite_mz_predictor/) and an open-source R package, Lipidepifind (https://github.com/Xinguang-Liu/Lipidepifind). Lipid epi-metabolites were then identified using four validation criteria: MS/MS analysis, retention order filtering, retention time calibration, and collision cross-section validation. Finally, differential structural modifications and putative enzyme-mediated reactions were characterized through multivariate statistics and epi-metabolic reaction enrichment analysis. We demonstrated the utility of this approach in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), identifying 725 lipid epi-metabolites in patient serum. Two enriched lipid oxidative cleavage reactions were observed, and two epi-metabolite biomarkers, phosphatidylcholine (16:0/9:0 (CHO)) and (16:0/5:0 (COOH)), were identified in IPF patients. This method outperformed conventional database-based strategies in matching and identifying lipid epi-metabolites and revealed differential lipid modifications and enzymatic processes in IPF.

LipiDetective	Lipidomics		Yes	Lipids are involved in many vital processes within the cell, and alterations in lipid homeostasis have been associated with various diseases such as cancer or type 2 diabetes. Confidently identifying lipids in samples is a prerequisite for understanding the multiple functions lipids fulfill in health and disease. However, the accurate identification of molecular lipid species based on tandem mass spectrometry data is still a key challenge in lipidomics. Most current approaches rely on using a custom pipeline to process and match the measured spectra against an in-house spectra reference library, which hinders the comparability of results. To address this challenge, a transformer model called LipiDetective was developed and trained on a dataset composed of reference spectra measured from lipid standards, spectra from databases, and published experiments, utilizing both shotgun as well as liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry. LipiDetective demonstrates, for the first time, that artificial neural networks can learn the characteristic lipid fragmentation patterns to automatically and accurately annotate molecular lipids species in tandem mass spectra independently of the experimental setup. The model can even correctly predict lipid species for which it has never seen a spectrum before as it is able to generalize the learned lipid fragmentation patterns. Analysis of the integrated gradients reveals that LipiDetective focuses on relevant peaks that can be matched to known fragments and are thus humanly interpretable. Therefore, LipiDetective has the potential to be a valuable tool to aid in the lipid identification process and support the comparability of results from different sources. Aside from Lipidetective as a "ready-to-use" application, this work primarily offers a deeper understanding of how the model functions and how future deep learning models for lipid identification in mass spectra could be improved.

LipiDisease	Lipidomics			Lipids exhibit an essential role in cellular assembly and signaling. Dysregulation of these functions has been linked with many complications including obesity, diabetes, metabolic disorders, cancer and more. Investigating lipid profiles in such conditions can provide insights into cellular functions and possible interventions. Hence the field of lipidomics is expanding in recent years. Even though the role of individual lipids in diseases has been investigated, there is no resource to perform disease enrichment analysis considering the cumulative association of a lipid set. To address this, we have implemented the LipiDisease web server. The tool analyzes millions of records from the PubMed biomedical literature database discussing lipids and diseases, predicts their association and ranks them according to false discovery rates generated by random simulations. The tool takes into account 4270 diseases and 4798 lipids. Since the tool extracts the information from PubMed records, the number of diseases and lipids will be expanded over time as the biomedical literature grows.

LipidOA	Lipidomics		Yes	The Paternò–Büchi (PB) reaction is a carbon–carbon double bond (C═C)-specific derivatization reaction that can be used to pinpoint the location(s) of C═C(s) in unsaturated lipids and quantitate the location of isomers when coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). As the data of PB-MS/MS are increasingly generated, the establishment of a corresponding data analysis tool is highly needed. Herein, LipidOA, a machine-learning and prior-knowledge-based data analysis tool, is developed to analyze PB-MS/MS data generated by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry workflows. LipidOA consists of four key functional modules to realize an annotation of glycerophospholipid (GPL) structures at the fatty acyl-specific C═C location level. These include (1) data preprocessing, (2) picking C═C diagnostic ions, (3) de novo annotation, and (4) result ranking. Importantly, in the result-ranking module, the reliability of structural annotation is sorted via the use of a machine learning classifier and comparison to the total fatty acid database generated from the same sample. LipidOA is trained and validated by four PB-MS/MS data sets acquired using different PB reagents on mass spectrometers of different resolutions and of different biological samples. Overall, LipidOA provides high precision (higher than 0.9) and a wide coverage for structural annotations of GPLs. These results demonstrate that LipidOA can be used as a robust and flexible tool for annotating PB-MS/MS data collected under different experimental conditions using different lipidomic workflows.

LipidOracle	Lipidomics			Electron-induced dissociation methods, particularly electron impact excitation of ions from organics (EIEIO), offer enhanced capabilities for lipid structural elucidation over traditional collision-induced dissociation. Despite their analytical promise, the practicality of EIEIO within routine liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) workflows remains largely unexplored. In this study, we optimized LC-EIEIO-MS analysis for the rapid and detailed structural annotation of glycerides and phospholipids. We evaluated the effects of reaction times, accumulation times, and electron kinetic energies using lipid standards from multiple classes and at varying concentrations. Our results revealed that short reaction times of 30 ms consistently yielded stronger diagnostic signals crucial for lipid class identification and sn-position discrimination at concentrations as low as 100 pg on column. To systematically infer the position of double bonds from EIEIO spectra, we introduced LipidOracle, a software that tests all possible isomers and correctly accounts for missing data, noise, and crowded spectra. We showed that longer accumulation times of 200 ms were most effective for the determination of carbon-carbon double bond (C=C) positions, particularly in polyunsaturated lipids. Overall, we demonstrate that comprehensive lipid structural characterization, including sn-position and double bond locations in fatty acyl chains, is achievable within typical LC-MS timescales (~0.2 s). Our findings outline practical guidelines and establish a two-tiered analytical strategy for high-throughput analysis of complex lipid samples by EIEIO.

LipidOz	Lipidomics		Yes	Lipids play essential roles in many biological processes and disease pathology, but unambiguous identification of lipids is complicated by the presence of multiple isomeric species differing by fatty acyl chain length, stereospecifically numbered (sn) position, and position/stereochemistry of double bonds. Conventional liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analyses enable the determination of fatty acyl chain lengths (and in some cases sn position) and number of double bonds, but not carbon-carbon double bond positions. Ozone-induced dissociation (OzID) is a gas-phase oxidation reaction that produces characteristic fragments from lipids containing double bonds. OzID can be incorporated into ion mobility spectrometry (IMS)-MS instruments for the structural characterization of lipids, including additional isomer separation and confident assignment of double bond positions. The complexity and repetitive nature of OzID data analysis and lack of software tool support have limited the application of OzID for routine lipidomics studies. Here, we present an open-source Python tool, LipidOz, for the automated determination of lipid double bond positions from OzID-IMS-MS data, which employs a combination of traditional automation and deep learning approaches. Our results demonstrate the ability of LipidOz to robustly assign double bond positions for lipid standard mixtures and complex lipid extracts, enabling practical application of OzID for future lipidomics.

LipidQuant 2.1	Lipidomics			LipidQuant 2.1 is a software written in Matlab, which is designed for the high-throughput processing of large lipidomic data sets measured by lipid class separation coupled with quadrupole time-of-flight (QTOF) high-resolution mass spectrometry (MS). The software enables the identification of lipid species based on defined mass accuracy. The main focus is on the right lipidomic quantitation using at least one internal standard per lipid class and the implementation of an automated procedure for Type I and Type II isotopic corrections necessary for the determination of accurate molar concentrations, which is not available for the majority of existing software solutions. LipidQuant 2.1 offers three options for peak assignment, visualization of the isotopic pattern, and automated calculation of m/z for various adduct ions. The initial lipidomic database covers 31 lipid classes with more than 2900 lipid species that occur primarily in the human lipidome, but users have the full flexibility to modify and extend the database according to their needs. All algorithms and the detailed user manual are provided. The reliability of LipidQuant 2.1 is demonstrated on a set of more than 250 biological samples measured by ultrahigh-performance supercritical liquid chromatography (UHPSFC) coupled with QTOF-MS.

LipidSig	Lipidomics			Abstract With the continuing rise of lipidomic studies, there is an urgent need for a useful and comprehensive tool to facilitate lipidomic data analysis. The most important features making lipids different from general metabolites are their various characteristics, including their lipid classes, double bonds, chain lengths, etc. Based on these characteristics, lipid species can be classified into different categories and, more interestingly, exert specific biological functions in a group. In an effort to simplify lipidomic analysis workflows and enhance the exploration of lipid characteristics, we have developed a highly flexible and user-friendly web server called LipidSig. It consists of five sections, namely, Profiling, Differential Expression, Correlation, Network and Machine Learning, and evaluates lipid effects on cellular or disease phenotypes. One of the specialties of LipidSig is the conversion between lipid species and characteristics according to a user-defined characteristics table. This function allows for efficient data mining for both individual lipids and subgroups of characteristics. To expand the server's practical utility, we also provide analyses focusing on fatty acid properties and multiple characteristics. In summary, LipidSig is expected to help users identify significant lipid-related features and to advance the field of lipid biology.

LipidSigR	Lipidomics			Abstract Motivation Lipidomics is a rapidly expanding field focused on studying lipid species and classes within biological systems. As the field evolves, there is an increasing demand for user-friendly, open-source software tools capable of handling large and complex datasets while keeping pace with technological advancements. LipidSig, a widely used web-based platform, has been instrumental in data analysis and visualization of lipidomics. However, its limitations become evident when users want to build customized workflows. To address the limitation, we developed a companion R package, LipidSigR, based on the R code of the LipidSig web platform. Results  LipidSigR offers greater flexibility, allowing researchers with basic R programming skills to modify and adapt workflows according to their needs. It has been rigorously tested following CRAN guidelines to ensure compatibility and reproducibility. In demonstrating its functionality, we analyze the case with commonly used experimental design, case versus control, in lipidomics studies. Researchers can follow the use case to explore the key capabilities and build customized lipidomics data analysis workflows using LipidSigR.

LipidSIM	Lipidomics			Lipid metabolism is a complex and dynamic system involving numerous enzymes at the junction of multiple metabolic pathways. Disruption of these pathways leads to systematic dyslipidemia, a hallmark of many pathological developments, such as nonalcoholic steatohepatitis and diabetes. Recent advances in computational tools can provide insights into the dysregulation of lipid biosynthesis, but limitations remain due to the complexity of lipidomic data, limited knowledge of interactions among involved enzymes, and technical challenges in standardizing across different lipid types. Here, we present a low-parameter, biologically interpretable framework named Lipid Synthesis Investigative Markov model (LipidSIM), which models and predicts the source of perturbations in lipid biosynthesis from lipidomic data. LipidSIM achieves this by accounting for the interdependency between the lipid species via the lipid biosynthesis network and generates testable hypotheses regarding changes in lipid biosynthetic reactions. This feature allows the integration of lipidomics with other omics types, such as transcriptomics, to elucidate the direct driving mechanisms of altered lipidomes due to treatments or disease progression. To demonstrate the value of LipidSIM, we first applied it to hepatic lipidomics following Keap1 knockdown and found that changes in mRNA expression of the lipid pathways were consistent with the LipidSIM-predicted fluxes. Second, we used it to study lipidomic changes following intraperitoneal injection of CCl4 to induce fast NAFLD/NASH development and the progression of fibrosis and hepatic cancer. Finally, to show the power of LipidSIM for classifying samples with dyslipidemia, we used a Dgat2-knockdown study dataset. Thus, we show that as it demands no a priori knowledge of enzyme kinetics, LipidSIM is a valuable and intuitive framework for extracting biological insights from complex lipidomic data.

LipidSpace	Lipidomics			Lipid analysis gained significant importance due to the enormous range of lipid functions, e.g., energy storage, signaling, or structural components. Whole lipidomes can be quantitatively studied in-depth thanks to recent analytical advancements. However, the systematic comparison of thousands of distinct lipidomes remains challenging. We introduce LipidSpace, a standalone tool for analyzing lipidomes by assessing their structural and quantitative differences. A graph-based comparison of lipid structures is the basis for calculating structural space models and subsequently computing lipidome similarities. When adding study variables such as body weight or health condition, LipidSpace can determine lipid subsets across all lipidomes that describe these study variables well by utilizing machine-learning approaches. The user-friendly GUI offers four built-in tutorials and interactive visual interfaces with pdf export. Many supported data formats allow an efficient (re)analysis of data sets from different sources. An integrated interactive workflow guides the user through the quality control steps. We used this suite to reanalyze and combine already published data sets (e.g., one with about 2500 samples and 576 lipids in one run) and made additional discoveries to the published conclusions with the potential to fill gaps in the current lipid biology understanding. LipidSpace is available for Windows or Linux (https://lifs-tools.org).

LipidSuite	Lipidomics			Advances in mass spectrometry enabled high throughput profiling of lipids but differential analysis and biological interpretation of lipidomics datasets remains challenging. To overcome this barrier, we present LipidSuite, an end-to-end differential lipidomics data analysis server. LipidSuite offers a step-by-step workflow for preprocessing, exploration, differential analysis and enrichment analysis of untargeted and targeted lipidomics. Three lipidomics data formats are accepted for upload: mwTab file from Metabolomics Workbench, Skyline CSV Export, and a numerical matrix. Experimental variables to be used in analysis are uploaded in a separate file. Conventional lipid names are automatically parsed to enable lipid class and chain length analyses. Users can interactively explore data, choose subsets based on sample types or lipid classes or characteristics, and conduct univariate, multivariate and unsupervised analyses. For complex experimental designs and clinical cohorts, LipidSuite offers confounding variables adjustment. Finally, data tables and plots can be both interactively viewed or downloaded for publication or reports. Overall, we anticipate this free, user-friendly webserver to facilitate differential lipidomics data analysis and re-analysis, and fully harness biological interpretation from lipidomics datasets.

LipoCLEAN	Lipidomics		Yes	In untargeted lipidomics experiments, putative lipid identifications generated by automated analysis software require substantial manual filtering to arrive at usable high-confidence data. However, identification software tools do not make full use of the available data to assess the quality of lipid identifications. Here, we present a machine-learning-based model to provide coherent, holistic quality scores based on multiple lines of evidence. Underutilized metrics such as isotope ratios and chromatographic behavior allow for much higher accuracy of identification confidence. We find that approximately 50% of tandem mass spectrometry-based automated lipid identifications are incorrect but that multidimensional rescoring reduces false discoveries to only 7% while retaining 80% of true positives. Our method works with most chromatography methods and generalizes across a family of MS instruments. LipoCLEAN is available at https://github.com/stavis1/LipoCLEAN.

LORA	Lipidomics			With the increasing number of lipidomic studies, there is a need for an efficient and automated analysis of lipidomic data. One of the challenges faced by most existing approaches to lipidomic data analysis is lipid nomenclature. The systematic nomenclature of lipids contains all available information about the molecule, including its hierarchical representation, which can be used for statistical evaluation. The Lipid Over-Representation Analysis (LORA) web application (https://lora.metabolomics.fgu.cas.cz) analyzes this information using the Java-based Goslin framework, which translates lipid names into a standardized nomenclature. Goslin provides the level of lipid hierarchy, including information on headgroups, acyl chains, and their modifications, up to the “complete structure” level. LORA allows the user to upload the experimental query and reference data sets, select a grammar for lipid name normalization, and then process the data. The user can then interactively explore the results and perform lipid over-representation analysis based on selected criteria. The results are graphically visualized according to the lipidome hierarchy. The lipids present in the most over-represented terms (lipids with the highest number of enriched shared structural features) are defined as Very Important Lipids (VILs). For example, the main result of a demo data set is the information that the query is significantly enriched with “glycerophospholipids” containing “acyl 20:4” at the “sn-2 position”. These terms define a set of VILs (e.g., PC 18:2/20:4;O and PE 16:0/20:4(5,8,10,14);OH). All results, graphs, and visualizations are summarized in a report. LORA is a tool focused on the smart mining of epilipidomics data sets to facilitate their interpretation at the molecular level.

MS-RIDD	Lipidomics			Mass spectrometry-based untargeted lipidomics has revealed the lipidome atlas of living organisms at the molecular species level. Despite the double bond (C = C) position being a crucial factor in biological system, the C = C defined structures have not yet been characterized comprehensively. Here, we present an approach for C = C position-resolved untargeted lipidomics using a combination of oxygen attachment dissociation and computational mass spectrometry to increase the annotation rate. We validated the accuracy of our platform as per the authentic standards of 85 lipids and the biogenic standards of 52 molecules containing polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) from the cultured cells fed with various fatty acid-enriched media. By analyzing human and mice-derived samples, we characterized 648 unique lipids with the C = C position-resolved level encompassing 24 lipid subclasses defined by LIPIDMAPS. Our platform also illuminated the unique profiles of tissue-specific lipids containing n-3 and/or n-6 very long-chain PUFAs (carbon 28 and double bonds 4) in the eye, testis, and brain of the mouse.

MS2Lipid	Lipidomics		Yes	Background: Untargeted lipidomics using collision-induced dissociation-based tandem mass spectrometry (CID-MS/MS) is essential for biological and clinical applications. However, annotation confidence still relies on manual curation by analytical chemists, despite the development of various software tools for automatic spectral processing based on rule-based fragment annotations. Methods: In this study, we present a novel machine learning model, MS2Lipid, for the prediction of known lipid subclasses from MS/MS queries, providing an orthogonal approach to existing lipidomics software programs in determining the lipid subclass of ion features. We designed a new descriptor, MCH (mode of carbon and hydrogen), to increase the specificity of lipid subclass prediction in nominal mass resolution MS data. Results: The model, trained with 6760 and 6862 manually curated MS/MS spectra for the positive and negative ion modes, respectively, classified queries into one or several of 97 lipid subclasses, achieving an accuracy of 97.4% in the test set. The program was further validated using various datasets from different instruments and curators, with the average accuracy exceeding 87.2%. Using an integrated approach with molecular spectral networking, we demonstrated the utility of MS2Lipid by annotating microbiota-derived esterified bile acids, whose abundance was significantly increased in fecal samples of obese patients in a human cohort study. This suggests that the machine learning model provides an independent criterion for lipid subclass classification, enhancing the annotation of lipid metabolites within known lipid classes. Conclusions: MS2Lipid is a highly accurate machine learning model that enhances lipid subclass annotation from MS/MS data and provides an independent criterion.

Neurolipid Atlas	Lipidomics			Lipid alterations in the brain have been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. To facilitate comparative lipidomic research across brain diseases, we establish a data common named the Neurolipid Atlas that we prepopulated with isogenic induced pluripotent stem cell (iPS cell)-derived lipidomics data for different brain diseases. Additionally, the resource contains lipidomics data of human and mouse brain tissue. Leveraging multiple datasets, we demonstrate that iPS cell-derived neurons, microglia and astrocytes exhibit distinct lipid profiles that recapitulate in vivo lipotypes. Notably, the Alzheimer disease (AD) risk gene ApoE4 drives cholesterol ester (CE) accumulation specifically in human astrocytes and we also observe CE accumulation in whole-brain lipidomics from persons with AD. Multiomics interrogation of iPS cell-derived astrocytes revealed that altered cholesterol metabolism has a major role in astrocyte immune pathways such as the immunoproteasome and major histocompatibility complex class I antigen presentation. Our data commons, available online (https://neurolipidatlas.com/), allows for data deposition by the community and provides a user-friendly tool and knowledge base for a better understanding of lipid dyshomeostasis in neurodegenerative diseases.

RefLAS	Lipidomics			Liquid chromatography coupled to high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS)-based methods have become the gold standard methodology for the comprehensive profiling of the human plasma lipidome. However, both the complexity of lipid chemistry and LC-HRMS-associated data pose challenges to the characterization of this biological matrix. In accordance with the current consensus of quality requirements for LC-HRMS lipidomics data, we aimed to characterize the NIST® Standard Reference Material for Human Plasma (SRM 1950) using an LC-ESI(+/−)-MS method compatible with high-throughput lipidome profiling. We generated a highly curated lipid database with increased coverage, quality, and consistency, including additional quality assurance procedures involving adduct formation, within-method m/z evaluation, retention behavior of species within lipid chain isomers, and expert-driven resolution of isomeric and isobaric interferences. As a proof-of-concept, we showed the utility of our in-house LC-MS lipidomic database —consisting of 592 lipid entries— for the fast, comprehensive, and reliable lipidomic profiling of the human plasma from healthy human volunteers. We are confident that the implementation of this robust resource and methodology will have a significant impact by reducing data redundancy and the current delays and bottlenecks in untargeted plasma lipidomic studies.

RPLC-IMS-CID-MS Lipid Database 	Lipidomics			The importance of lipids in biology continues to grow with their recent linkages to more diseases and conditions, microbiome fluctuations, and environmental exposures. These associations have motivated researchers to evaluate lipidomic changes in numerous matrices and studies. Lipidomic analyses, however, present numerous challenges as lipid species have broad chemistries that require different extraction methods and instrumental analyses to evaluate and separate their many isomers and isobars. Increasing knowledge about different lipid characteristics is therefore crucial for improving their separation and identification. Here, we present a multidimensional database for lipids analyzed on a platform combining reversed-phase liquid chromatography, drift tube ion mobility spectrometry, collision-induced dissociation, and mass spectrometry (RPLC-DTIMS-CID-MS). This platform and the different separation characteristics it provides enables more confident lipid annotations when compared to traditional tandem mass spectrometry platforms, especially when analyzing highly isomeric molecules such as lipids. This database expands on our previous publication containing only human plasma and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid lipids and provides experimental RPLC retention times, IMS collision cross section (CCS) values, and m/z information for 877 unique lipids from additional biofluids and tissues. Specifically, the database contains 1504 precursor [M + H]+, [M + NH4]+, [M + Na]+, [M-H]−, [M-2H]2−, [M + HCOO]−, and [M + CH3COO]− ion species and their associated CID fragments which are commonly targeted in clinical and environmental studies, in addition to being present in the chloroform layer of Folch extractions. Furthermore, this multidimensional RPLC-DTIMS-CID-MS database spans 5 lipid categories (fatty acids, sterols, sphingolipids, glycerolipids, and glycerophospholipids) and 24 lipid classes. We have also created a webpage (tarheels.live/bakerlab/databases/) to enhance the accessibility of this resource which will be populated regularly with new lipids as we identify additional species and integrate novel standards.

RTStaR	Lipidomics			Bioinformatic tools capable of registering, rapidly and reproducibly, large numbers of nanoliquid chromatography-nanoelectrospray ionization-tandem mass spectrometry (nLC-nESI-MS/MS) lipidomic datasets are lacking. We provide here a freely available Retention Time Standardization and Registration (RTStaR) algorithm that aligns nLC-nESI-MS/MS spectra within a single dataset and compares these aligned retention times across multiple datasets. This two-step calibration matches corresponding and identifies unique lipid species in different lipidomes from different matrices and organisms. RTStaR was developed using a population-based study of 1001 human serum samples composed of 71 distinct glycerophosphocholine metabolites comprising a total of 68,572 analytes. Platform and matrix independence were validated using different MS instruments, nLC methodologies, and mammalian lipidomes. The complete algorithm is packaged in two modular ExcelTM workbook templates for easy implementation.

Amanida	Specialized			The combination, analysis and evaluation of different studies which try to answer or solve the same scientific question, also known as a meta-analysis, plays a crucial role in answering relevant clinical relevant questions. Unfortunately, metabolomics studies rarely disclose all the statistical information needed to perform a meta-analysis. Here, we present a meta-analysis approach using only the most reported statistical parameters in this field: P-value and fold-change. The P-values are combined via Fisher’s method and fold-changes by averaging, both weighted by the study size (n). The amanida package includes several visualization options: a volcano plot for quantitative results, a vote plot for total regulation behaviours (up/down regulations) for each compound, and a explore plot of the vote-counting results with the number of times a compound is found upregulated or downregulated. In this way, it is very easy to detect discrepancies between studies at a first glance.

Easy-Amanida	Specialized			Meta-analysis is a useful tool in clinical research, as it combines the results of multiple clinical studies to improve precision when answering a particular scientific question. While there has been a substantial increase in publications using meta-analysis in various clinical research topics, the number of published meta-analyses in metabolomics is significantly lower compared to other omics disciplines. Metabolomics is the study of small chemical compounds in living organisms, which provides important insights into an organism's phenotype. However, the wide variety of compounds and the different experimental methods used in metabolomics make it challenging to perform a thorough meta-analysis. Additionally, there is a lack of consensus on reporting statistical estimates, and the high number of compound naming synonyms further complicates the process. Easy-Amanida is a new tool that combines two R packages, “amanida” and “webchem”, to enable meta-analysis of aggregate statistical data, like p-value and fold-change, while ensuring the compounds naming harmonization. The Easy-Amanida app is implemented in Shiny, an R package add-on for interactive web apps, and provides a workflow to optimize the naming combination. This article describes all the steps to perform the meta-analysis using Easy-Amanida, including an illustrative example for interpreting the results. The use of aggregate statistics metrics extends the use of Easy-Amanida beyond the metabolomics field.

DNEA	Metabolic networks			Background Metabolomics is a high-throughput technology that measures small molecule metabolites in cells, tissues or biofluids. Analysis of metabolomics data is a multi-step process that involves data processing, quality control and normalization, followed by statistical and bioinformatics analysis. The latter step often involves pathway analysis to aid biological interpretation of the data. This approach is limited to endogenous metabolites that can be readily mapped to metabolic pathways. An alternative to pathway analysis that can be used for any classes of metabolites, including unknown compounds that are ubiquitous in untargeted metabolomics data, involves defining metabolite-metabolite interactions using experimental data. Our group has developed several network-based methods that use partial correlations of experimentally determined metabolite measurements. These were implemented in CorrelationCalculator and Filigree, two software tools for the analysis of metabolomics data we developed previously. The latter tool implements the Differential Network Enrichment Analysis (DNEA) algorithm. This analysis is useful for building differential networks from metabolomics data containing two experimental groups and identifying differentially enriched metabolic modules. While Filigree is a user-friendly tool, it has certain limitations when used for the analysis of large-scale metabolomics datasets. Results  We developed the DNEA R package for the data-driven network analysis of metabolomics data. We present the DNEA workflow and functionality, algorithm enhancements implemented with respect to the package’s predecessor, Filigree, and discuss best practices for analyses. We tested the performance of the DNEA R package and illustrated its features using publicly available metabolomics data from the environmental determinants of diabetes in the young. To our knowledge, this package is the only publicly available tool designed for the construction of biological networks and subsequent enrichment testing for datasets containing exogenous, secondary, and unknown compounds. This greatly expands the scope of traditional enrichment analysis tools that can be used to analyze a relatively small set of well-annotated metabolites. Conclusions  The DNEA R package is a more flexible and powerful implementation of our previously published software tool, Filigree. The modular structure of the package, along with the parallel processing framework built into the most computationally extensive steps of the algorithm, make it a powerful tool for the analysis of large and complex metabolomics datasets.

FNICM	Metabolic networks			Metabolomics has emerged as a powerful tool in biomedical research to understand the pathophysiological processes and metabolic biomarkers of diseases. Nevertheless, it is a significant challenge in metabolomics to identify the reliable core metabolites that are closely associated with the occurrence or progression of diseases. Here, we proposed a new research framework by integrating detection-based metabolomics with computational network biology for function-guided and network-based identification of core metabolites, namely, FNICM. The proposed FNICM methodology is successfully utilized to uncover ulcerative colitis (UC)-related core metabolites based on the significantly perturbed metabolic subnetwork. First, seed metabolites were screened out using prior biological knowledge and targeted metabolomics. Second, by leveraging network topology, the perturbations of the detected seed metabolites were propagated to other undetected ones. Ultimately, 35 core metabolites were identified by controllability analysis and were further hierarchized into six levels based on confidence level and their potential significance. The specificity and generalizability of the discovered core metabolites, used as UC’s diagnostic markers, were further validated using published data sets of UC patients. More importantly, we demonstrated the broad applicability and practicality of the FNICM framework in different contexts by applying it to multiple clinical data sets, including inflammatory bowel disease, colorectal cancer, and acute coronary syndrome. In addition, FNICM was also demonstrated as a practicality methodology to identify core metabolites correlated with the therapeutic effects of Clematis saponins. Overall, the FNICM methodology is a new framework for identifying reliable core metabolites for disease diagnosis and drug treatment from a systemic and a holistic perspective.

KGMN	Metabolic networks			Liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) based untargeted metabolomics allows to measure both known and unknown metabolites in the metabolome. However, unknown metabolite annotation is a major challenge in untargeted metabolomics. Here, we develop an approach, namely, knowledge-guided multi-layer network (KGMN), to enable global metabolite annotation from knowns to unknowns in untargeted metabolomics. The KGMN approach integrates three-layer networks, including knowledge-based metabolic reaction network, knowledge-guided MS/MS similarity network, and global peak correlation network. To demonstrate the principle, we apply KGMN in an in vitro enzymatic reaction system and different biological samples, with ~100–300 putative unknowns annotated in each data set. Among them, >80% unknown metabolites are corroborated with in silico MS/MS tools. Finally, we validate 5 metabolites that are absent in common MS/MS libraries through repository mining and synthesis of chemical standards. Together, the KGMN approach enables efficient unknown annotations, and substantially advances the discovery of recurrent unknown metabolites for common biological samples from model organisms, towards deciphering dark matter in untargeted metabolomics.

Kiphynet	Metabolic networks			Introduction Human metabolism is sustained by functional networks that operate at diverse scales. Capturing local and global dynamics in the human body by hierarchically bridging multi-scale functional networks is a major challenge in physiological modeling. Objectives To develop an interactive, user-friendly web application that facilitates the simulation and visualization of advection-dispersion transport in three-dimensional (3D) microvascular networks, biochemical exchange, and metabolic reactions in the tissue layer surrounding the vasculature. Methods To help modelers combine and simulate biochemical processes occurring at multiple scales, KiPhyNet deploys our discrete graph-based modeling framework that bridges functional networks existing at diverse scales. KiPhyNet is implemented in Python based on Apache web server using MATLAB as the simulator engine.

M2R	Metabolic networks			Motivation The gut microbiota is the human body’s largest population of microorganisms that interact with human intestinal cells. They use ingested nutrients for fundamental biological processes and have important impacts on human physiology, immunity and metabolome in the gastrointestinal tract. Results  Here, we present M2R, a Python add-on to cobrapy that allows incorporating information about the gut microbiota metabolism models to human genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) like RECON3D. The idea behind the software is to modify the lower bounds of the exchange reactions in the model using aggregated in- and out-fluxes from selected microbes. M2R enables users to quickly and easily modify the pool of the metabolites that enter and leave the GEM, which is particularly important for those looking into an analysis of the metabolic interaction between the gut microbiota and human cells and its dysregulation.

MetaboliticsDB	Metabolic networks			Web-based metabolomics databases store relative metabolite abundance datasets measured under different physiological conditions. However, their pathway-level analysis capabilities are mostly limited to superimposing the measurements onto the pathways of the measured metabolites. Besides, none of the existing metabolomics databases offer tools to store, manage, compare, and search metabolomics analysis results. In this paper, we present MetaboliticsDB, which features a database of metabolomics analyses and a set of associated analytics tools. It enables users to store and compare their metabolomics analysis results against others to study, for instance, the progression of a disease. Moreover, MetaboliticsDB implements a genome-scale metabolic network-based analysis tool (i.e., Metabolitics) that performs network-based flux analysis. Besides, MetaboliticsDB features an advanced querying interface offering flexible criteria, such as listing all analyses where a certain pathway experiences a major increase in activity, to help researchers identify conditions sharing a similar mechanism. Finally, MetaboliticsDB employs AI-based models to associate the studied metabolomics data with diseases. Currently, the database contains analysis results for 2,174 individuals and 40 diseases. We demonstrate MetaboliticsDB’s usage with a case study on Hepatocellular Carcinoma. Our experimental evaluation shows that MetaboliticsDB provides biologically relevant metabolic network-level analysis results, disease association with high accuracy, and a scalable architecture.

MetNet	Metabolic networks			Metabolic pathway comparison and interaction between different species can detect important information for drug engineering and medical science. In the literature, proposals for reconstructing and comparing metabolic networks present two main problems: network reconstruction requires usually human intervention to integrate information from different sources and, in metabolic comparison, the size of the networks leads to a challenging computational problem. We propose to automatically reconstruct a metabolic network on the basis of KEGG database information. Our proposal relies on a two-level representation of the huge metabolic network: the first level is graph-based and depicts pathways as nodes and relations between pathways as edges; the second level represents each metabolic pathway in terms of its reactions content. The two-level representation complies with the KEGG database, which decomposes the metabolism of all the different organisms into “reference” pathways in a standardised way. On the basis of this two-level representation, we introduce some similarity measures for both levels. They allow for both a local comparison, pathway by pathway, and a global comparison of the entire metabolism. We developed a tool, MetNet, that implements the proposed methodology. MetNet makes it possible to automatically reconstruct the metabolic network of two organisms selected in KEGG and to compare their two networks both quantitatively and visually. We validate our methodology by presenting some experiments performed with MetNet.

MINNO	Metabolic networks			Metabolomics is a powerful tool for uncovering biochemical diversity in a wide range of organisms. Metabolic network modeling is commonly used to frame metabolomics data in the context of a broader biological system. However, network modeling of poorly characterized nonmodel organisms remains challenging due to gene homology mismatches which lead to network architecture errors. To address this, we developed the Metabolic Interactive Nodular Network for Omics (MINNO), a web-based mapping tool that uses empirical metabolomics data to refine metabolic networks. MINNO allows users to create, modify, and interact with metabolic pathway visualizations for thousands of organisms, in both individual and multispecies contexts. Herein, we illustrate the use of MINNO in elucidating the metabolic networks of understudied species, such as those of the Borrelia genus, which cause Lyme and relapsing fever diseases. Using a hybrid genomics-metabolomics modeling approach, we constructed species-specific metabolic networks for threeBorrelia species. Using these empirically refined networks, we were able to metabolically differentiate these species via their nucleotide metabolism, which cannot be predicted from genomic networks. Additionally, using MINNO, we identified 18 missing reactions from the KEGG database, of which nine were supported by the primary literature. These examples illustrate the use of metabolomics for the empirical refining of genetically constructed networks and show how MINNO can be used to study nonmodel organisms.

NetAurHPD	Metabolic networks			Metabolite biosynthesis is regulated via metabolic pathways, which can be activated and deactivated within organisms. Understanding and identifying an organism's metabolic pathway network is a crucial aspect for various research fields, including crop and life stock breeding, pharmacology, and medicine. The problem of identifying whether a pathway is part of a studied metabolic system is commonly framed as a hyperlink prediction problem. The most important challenge in prediction of metabolic pathways is the sparsity of the labeled data. This challenge can partially be mitigated using metabolite correlation networks which are affected by all active pathways including those that were not confirmed yet in laboratory experiments. Unfortunately, extracting properties that can confirm or refute existence of a metabolic pathway in a particular organism is not a trivial task. In this research, we introduce the Network Auralization Hyperlink Prediction (NetAurHPD) which is a framework that relies on (1) graph auralization to extract and aggregate representations of nodes in metabolite correlation networks and (2) data augmentation method that generates metabolite correlation networks given a subset of chemical reactions defined as hyperlinks. Experiments with metabolites correlation-based networks of tomato pericarp demonstrate promising results for NetAurHPD, compared to alternative methods. Furthermore, the application of data augmentation improved NetAurHPD's learning capabilities and overall performance. Additionally, NetAurHPD outperformed state-of-the-art method in experiments under challenging conditions, and has the potential to be a valuable tool for exploring organisms with limited existing knowledge.

Recon8D	Metabolic networks		Yes	Abstract   To explore multiomic regulation of the metabolome, we used machine learning to predict metabolomic variation across ∼1000 different cancer cell lines with matched omics data from 8 biomolecular classes: genomics (copy-number and mutations), epigenomics (histone post-translational modifications (PTMs) and DNA-methylation), transcriptomics and RNA splice variants, non-coding transcriptomics (miRNA and lncRNA), proteomics, and phosphoproteomics. Overall, the metabolome is tightly associated with the transcriptome, with coding and non-coding RNAs emerging as top predictors. Peripheral metabolites are predictable via levels of corresponding enzymes, while those in central metabolism require combinatorial predictors in signaling and redox pathways, and may not reflect corresponding pathway expression. We reconstruct multiomic interaction subnetworks for highly predictable metabolites, and YAP1 signaling emerged as a top global predictor across 4 omic layers. We prioritize predictive multiomic features for single-cell and spatial metabolomics assays. Top predictors were enriched for synthetic-lethal interactions and synergistic combination therapies that target compensatory metabolic modulators.

Thermo-Flux	Metabolic networks			Metabolic modelling, particularly through genome-scale stoichiometric models and flux balance analysis (FBA), has greatly advanced our understanding of metabolism. Yet, there is a continued quest to further improve the predictive capabilities of FBA. While thermodynamic constraints can allow for improved predictions, their addition to metabolic models has so far required cumbersome manual curation. To circumvent manual curation, we introduce ‘Thermo-Flux’, a semi-automated Python package, which converts stoichiometric metabolic network models into comprehensive thermodynamic-stoichiometric models for improved predictions. ‘Thermo-Flux’ enables (i) automated mass and charge balancing while considering physical and biochemical parameters, (ii) definition of transporter variants and Gibbs energies for membrane transport, (iii) robust handling of metabolites with unknown structures or Gibbs energies, and integrates (iv) recent advances in determining Gibbs energies and their respective uncertainties. To guide users in the conversion of stoichiometric models into comprehensive thermodynamic-stoichiometric models, we provide detailed instructions on how to use the ‘Thermo-Flux’ pipeline and include background information to enable appropriate modeling assumptions. By converting 87 stoichiometric models from the BiGG database and demonstrating improved flux predictions for a genome-scale yeast model (iMM904) converted into a thermodynamic-stoichiometric model, we showcase the applicability of ‘Thermo-Flux’. We expect ‘Thermo-Flux’ to support fundamental metabolic research and biotechnological applications. The package is available at https://github.com/molecular-systems-biology/thermo-flux along with tutorials.

MicroMap	Metabolic networks/Visualization			The human microbiome critically influences metabolism and thereby our health. Constraint-based reconstruction and analysis (COBRA) is a proven framework for generating mechanism-derived hypotheses along the nutrition-host-microbiome-disease axis. However, no large-scale microbiome metabolism visualisation has been available. Therefore, we created the MicroMap, a manually curated network visualisation, which captures the metabolism of over a quarter million microbial genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. The MicroMap contains 5064 unique reactions and 3499 unique metabolites, including for 98 drugs. Users can intuitively explore microbiome metabolism, inspect metabolic capabilities, and visualise computational modelling results. Further, the MicroMap may serve as an educational tool to help diversify the computational modelling community. We generated 257,429 visualisations, covering all our current microbiome reconstructions, to visually compare metabolic capabilities between microbes. The MicroMap integrates with the Virtual Metabolic Human (VMH) database, the COBRA Toolbox, and is freely accessible at the MicroMap dataverse, along with all the generated reconstruction visualisations.

MatrixLM	Metadata			Background/Objectives: High-throughput metabolomics data provide a detailed molecular window into biological processes. We consider the problem of assessing how association of metabolite levels with individual (sample) characteristics, such as sex or treatment, depend on metabolite characteristics such as pathways. Typically, this is done using a two-step process. In the first step, we assess the association of each metabolite with individual characteristics. In the second step, an enrichment analysis is performed by metabolite characteristics. Methods: We combine the two steps using a bilinear model based on the matrix linear model (MLM) framework previously developed for high-throughput genetic screens. Our method can estimate relationships in metabolites sharing known characteristics, whether categorical (such as type of lipid or pathway) or numerical (such as number of double bonds in triglycerides). Results: We demonstrate the flexibility and interoperability of MLMs by applying them to three metabolomic studies. We show that our approach can separate the contribution of the overlapping triglyceride characteristics, such as the number of double bonds and the number of carbon atoms. Conclusion: The matrix linear model offers a flexible, efficient, and interpretable framework for integrating external information and examining complex relationships in metabolomics data. Our method has been implemented in the open-source Julia package, MatrixLM. Data analysis scripts with example data analyses are also available.

PeakForest	Metadata			Introduction Accuracy of feature annotation and metabolite identification in biological samples is a key element in metabolomics research. However, the annotation process is often hampered by the lack of spectral reference data in experimental conditions, as well as logistical difficulties in the spectral data management and exchange of annotations between laboratories. Objectives  To design an open-source infrastructure allowing hosting both nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and mass spectra (MS), with an ergonomic Web interface and Web services to support metabolite annotation and laboratory data management. Methods  We developed the PeakForest infrastructure, an open-source Java tool with automatic programming interfaces that can be deployed locally to organize spectral data for metabolome annotation in laboratories. Standardized operating procedures and formats were included to ensure data quality and interoperability, in line with international recommendations and FAIR principles. Results  PeakForest is able to capture and store experimental spectral MS and NMR metadata as well as collect and display signal annotations. This modular system provides a structured database with inbuilt tools to curate information, browse and reuse spectral information in data treatment. PeakForest offers data formalization and centralization at the laboratory level, facilitating shared spectral data across laboratories and integration into public databases. Conclusion  PeakForest is a comprehensive resource which addresses a technical bottleneck, namely large-scale spectral data annotation and metabolite identification for metabolomics laboratories with multiple instruments. PeakForest databases can be used in conjunction with bespoke data analysis pipelines in the Galaxy environment, offering the opportunity to meet the evolving needs of metabolomics research. Developed and tested by the French metabolomics community, PeakForest is freely-available at https://github.com/peakforest.

SMetaS	Metadata			Metabolomics has advanced to an extent where it is desired to standardize and compare data across individual studies. While past work in standardization has focused on data acquisition, data processing, and data storage aspects, metabolomics databases are useless without ontology-based descriptions of biological samples and study designs. We introduce here a user-centric tool to automatically standardize sample metadata. Using such a tool in frontends for metabolomic databases will dramatically increase the FAIRness (Findability, Accessibility, Interoperability, and Reusability) of data, specifically for data reuse and for finding datasets that share comparable sets of metadata, e.g., study meta-analyses, cross-species analyses or large scale metabolomic atlases. SMetaS (Sample Metadata Standardizer) combines a classic database with an API and frontend and is provided in a containerized environment. The tool has two user-centric components. In the first component, the user designs a sample metadata matrix and fills the cells using natural language terminology. In the second component, the tool transforms the completed matrix by replacing freetext terms with terms from fixed vocabularies. This transformation process is designed to maximize simplicity and is guided by, among other strategies, synonym matching and typographical fixing in an n-grams/nearest neighbors model approach. The tool enables downstream analysis of submitted studies and samples via string equality for FAIR retrospective use.

MetaXtract	Metadata/Quality Control			Mass spectrometry (MS) experiments generate rich acquisition metadata that are essential for reproducibility, data sharing, and quality control (QC). Because these metadata are typically stored only in vendor-specific formats, they often remain difficult to access. MetaXtract is a lightweight tool that extracts detailed parameters directly from Thermo Fisher raw files and exposes them in structured, tabular formats. By capturing sample information, LC-MS method settings, and scan-level metrics such as retention time, total ion current, and ion injection time, MetaXtract increases transparency and ensures that essential acquisition details accompany published data and results in easy readable form. This supports FAIR data practices by improving the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of MS datasets, thereby increasing the value of deposition in public repositories. The importance of such metadata accessibility was recently highlighted by the crosslinking mass spectrometry community in efforts to advance FAIR data principles, and it extends to MS-based omics approaches more broadly. Beyond data sharing, the tool streamlines QC and troubleshooting through simple visualisations of MS1/MS2 scans and enables integration into automated pipelines. By embedding acquisition parameters into routine data handling, MetaXtract strengthens reproducibility, optimises method development, and supports large-scale applications, including machine learning and secondary data analysis.

BUDDY	Multifunctional			A substantial fraction of metabolic features remains undetermined in mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics, and molecular formula annotation is the starting point for unraveling their chemical identities. Here we present bottom-up tandem MS (MS/MS) interrogation, a method for de novo formula annotation. Our approach prioritizes MS/MS-explainable formula candidates, implements machine-learned ranking and offers false discovery rate estimation. Compared with the mathematically exhaustive formula enumeration, our approach shrinks the formula candidate space by 42.8% on average. Method benchmarking on annotation accuracy was systematically carried out on reference MS/MS libraries and real metabolomics datasets. Applied on 155,321 recurrent unidentified spectra, our approach confidently annotated >5,000 novel molecular formulae absent from chemical databases. Beyond the level of individual metabolic features, we combined bottom-up MS/MS interrogation with global optimization to refine formula annotations while revealing peak interrelationships. This approach allowed the systematic annotation of 37 fatty acid amide molecules in human fecal data. All bioinformatics pipelines are available in a standalone software, BUDDY (https://github.com/HuanLab/BUDDY).

DEIMoS	Multifunctional			We present DEIMoS: Data Extraction for Integrated Multidimensional Spectrometry, a Python application programming interface (API) and command-line tool for high-dimensional mass spectrometry data analysis workflows that offers ease of development and access to efficient algorithmic implementations. Functionality includes feature detection, feature alignment, collision cross section (CCS) calibration, isotope detection, and MS/MS spectral deconvolution, with the output comprising detected features aligned across study samples and characterized by mass, CCS, tandem mass spectra, and isotopic signature. Notably, DEIMoS operates on N-dimensional data, largely agnostic to acquisition instrumentation; algorithm implementations simultaneously utilize all dimensions to (i) offer greater separation between features, thus improving detection sensitivity, (ii) increase alignment/feature matching confidence among data sets, and (iii) mitigate convolution artifacts in tandem mass spectra. We demonstrate DEIMoS with LC-IMS-MS/MS metabolomics data to illustrate the advantages of a multidimensional approach in each data processing step.

eMZed 3	Multifunctional			Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data analysis requires adaptable software solutions to meet diverse analytical needs. We present eMZed 3, a modern Python framework for flexible and interactive analysis of LC-MS/MS data. eMZed 3 enables users to develop scalable workflows tailored to their specific requirements while leveraging Python's extensive ecosystem of libraries. Building on its predecessor, eMZed 3 is now Python 3-based and includes substantial enhancements, including support for chromatogram-based LC-MS data, a new SQLite-based backend supporting optional out-of-memory processing, and rich interactive visualization tools. Compared to the previous version, eMZed 3 is now split into three packages: emzed (core functionalities), emzed-gui (interactive data visualization), and emzed-spyder (an integrated development environment). This modular architecture allows straightforward integration of the emzed core library into headless Python environments, including computational notebooks (such as Jupyter) or high-performance computing clusters. eMZed 3 incorporates well-established libraries such as OpenMS, and is highly suited for both targeted and untargeted metabolomics. Overall, eMZed 3 supports the efficient development of scalable and reproducible LC-MS data analysis and is accessible to both novice and advanced programmers.

FERMO	Multifunctional			Small molecules can selectively modulate biological processes and thus generate phenotypic variation. Biological samples are complex matrices, and liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry often detects hundreds of molecules, of which only a fraction may be associated with this variation. The challenge therefore lies in the prioritization of the most relevant molecules for further investigation. Tools are needed to effectively contextualize mass spectrometric data with phenotypical and environmental (meta)data. To accelerate this task, we developed FERMO, a dashboard application combining mass spectrometry data with qualitative and quantitative biological observations. FERMO’s centralized interface enables users to rapidly inspect data, formulate hypotheses, and prioritize molecules of interest. We demonstrate the applicability of FERMO in a case study on antibiotic activity of bacterial extracts, where we successfully prioritized the bioactive molecule siomycin out of 143 molecular features. We expect that besides natural product discovery, FERMO will find application in a wide range of omics-driven fields.

iMAP	Multifunctional			Metabolomics data analysis depends on the utilization of bioinformatics tools. To meet the evolving needs of metabolomics research, several integrated platforms have been developed. Our group has developed a desktop platform IP4M (integrated Platform for Metabolomics Data Analysis) which allows users to perform a nearly complete metabolomics data analysis in one-stop. With the extensive usage of IP4M, more and more demands were raised from users worldwide for a web version and a more customized workflow. Thus, iMAP (integrated Metabolomics Analysis Platform) was developed with extended functions, improved performances, and redesigned structures. Compared with existing platforms, iMAP has more methods and usage modes. A new module was developed with an automatic pipeline for train-test set separation, feature selection, and predictive model construction and validation. A new module was incorporated with sufficient editable parameters for network construction, visualization, and analysis. Moreover, plenty of plotting tools have been upgraded for highly customized publication-ready figures. Overall, iMAP is a good alternative tool with complementary functions to existing metabolomics data analysis platforms. iMAP is freely available for academic usage at https://imap.metaboprofile.cloud/ (License MPL 2.0).	iMAP: A Web Server for Metabolomics Data Integrative Analysis	https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fchem.2021.659656/full	Frontiers in Chemistry	Zhou, Di , Zhu, Wenjia , Sun, Tao , Wang, Yang , Chi, Yi , Chen, Tianlu , & Lin, Jingchao (2021). iMAP: A Web Server for Metabolomics Data Integrative Analysis.

MargheRita	Multifunctional			Untargeted metabolomics by mass spectrometry technologies generates huge numbers of metabolite signals, requiring computational analyses for post-acquisition processing and databases for metabolite identification. Web-based data processing solutions frequently include only a part of the entire workflow thus requiring the use of different platforms. The R package “margheRita” enhances fragment matching accuracy and addresses the complete workflow for metabolomic profiling in untargeted studies based on liquid chromatography (LC) coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS), especially in the case of data-independent acquisition, where all MS/MS spectra are acquired with high quantitative accuracy.

Mass-Suite	Multifunctional			Abstract Mass-Suite (MSS) is a Python-based, open-source software package designed to analyze high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based non-targeted analysis (NTA) data, particularly for water quality assessment and other environmental applications. MSS provides flexible, user-defined workflows for HRMS data processing and analysis, including both basic functions (e.g., feature extraction, data reduction, feature annotation, data visualization, and statistical analyses) and advanced exploratory data mining and predictive modeling capabilities that are not provided by currently available open-source software (e.g., unsupervised clustering analyses, a machine learning-based source tracking and apportionment tool). As a key advance, most core MSS functions are supported by machine learning algorithms (e.g., clustering algorithms and predictive modeling algorithms) to facilitate function accuracy and/or efficiency. MSS reliability was validated with mixed chemical standards of known composition, with 99.5% feature extraction accuracy and ~ 52% overlap of extracted features relative to other open-source software tools. Example user cases of laboratory data evaluation are provided to illustrate MSS functionalities and demonstrate reliability. MSS expands available HRMS data analysis workflows for water quality evaluation and environmental forensics, and is readily integrated with existing capabilities. As an open-source package, we anticipate further development of improved data analysis capabilities in collaboration with interested users.

matchms	Multifunctional			Mass spectral libraries have proven to be essential for mass spectrum annotation, both for library matching and training new machine learning algorithms. A key step in training machine learning models is the availability of high-quality training data. Public libraries of mass spectrometry data that are open to user submission often suffer from limited metadata curation and harmonization. The resulting variability in data quality makes training of machine learning models challenging. Here we present a library cleaning pipeline designed for cleaning tandem mass spectrometry library data. The pipeline is designed with ease of use, flexibility, and reproducibility as leading principles.

MetaboAnalyst 5.0	Multifunctional			Liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC–HRMS) has become a workhorse in global metabolomics studies with growing applications across biomedical and environmental sciences. However, outstanding bioinformatics challenges in terms of data processing, statistical analysis and functional interpretation remain critical barriers to the wider adoption of this technology. To help the user community overcome these barriers, we have made major updates to the well-established MetaboAnalyst platform ( www.metaboanalyst.ca ). This protocol extends the previous 2011 Nature Protocol by providing stepwise instructions on how to use MetaboAnalyst 5.0 to: optimize parameters for LC–HRMS spectra processing; obtain functional insights from peak list data; integrate metabolomics data with transcriptomics data or combine multiple metabolomics datasets; conduct exploratory statistical analysis with complex metadata. Parameter optimization may take ~2 h to complete depending on the server load, and the remaining three stages may be executed in ~60 min. LC–HRMS is used for metabolomics studies in the biomedical and environmental sciences. MetaboAnalyst (metaboanalyst.ca) can be used to address challenges in data processing, statistical analysis, functional interpretation and multi-omics integration.

MetaboAnalystR 4.0	Multifunctional			Abstract The wide applications of liquid chromatography - mass spectrometry (LC-MS) in untargeted metabolomics demand an easy-to-use, comprehensive computational workflow to support efficient and reproducible data analysis. However, current tools were primarily developed to perform specific tasks in LC-MS based metabolomics data analysis. Here we introduce MetaboAnalystR 4.0 as a streamlined pipeline covering raw spectra processing, compound identification, statistical analysis, and functional interpretation. The key features of MetaboAnalystR 4.0 includes an auto-optimized feature detection and quantification algorithm for LC-MS1 spectra processing, efficient MS2 spectra deconvolution and compound identification for data-dependent or data-independent acquisition, and more accurate functional interpretation through integrated spectral annotation. Comprehensive validation studies using LC-MS1 and MS2 spectra obtained from standards mixtures, dilution series and clinical metabolomics samples have shown its excellent performance across a wide range of common tasks such as peak picking, spectral deconvolution, and compound identification with good computing efficiency. Together with its existing statistical analysis utilities, MetaboAnalystR 4.0 represents a significant step toward a unified, end-to-end workflow for LC-MS based global metabolomics in the open-source R environment.

MetaboLink	Multifunctional			Motivation   The post-processing and analysis of large-scale untargeted metabolomics data face significant challenges due to the intricate nature of correction, filtration, imputation, and normalization steps. Manual execution across various applications often leads to inefficiencies, human-induced errors, and inconsistencies within the workflow.         Results   Addressing these issues, we introduce MetaboLink, a novel web application designed to process LC-MS metabolomics datasets combining established methodologies and offering flexibility and ease of implementation. It offers visualization options for data interpretation, an interface for statistical testing, and integration with PolySTest for further tests and with VSClust for clustering analysis.         Availability and implementation   Fully functional tool is publicly available at https://computproteomics.bmb.sdu.dk/Metabolomics/.

MetaProViz	Multifunctional			With the growing number of metabolomics and lipidomics studies, robust strategies for bioinformatic analyses are increasingly important. However, the absence of standardized and reproducible workflows, coupled with ambiguous metabolite annotations, hampers effective analysis, particularly when integrating prior knowledge with metabolomics data. Moreover, the limited availability of comprehensive, curated prior knowledge further limits functional analyses and reduces the extraction of meaningful biological insights.    Here we present MetaProViz (Metabolomics Processing, functional analysis and Visualization), a free open-source R package for metabolomics data analysis that integrates prior knowledge to generate mechanistic hypotheses (https://saezlab.github.io/MetaProViz/). MetaProViz offers a flexible framework consisting of five modules: processing, differential analysis, prior knowledge integration, functional analysis and visualisation, applicable to both intracellular and exometabolomics experiments. To improve functional analysis, we created the Metabolism Signature Database (MetSigDB), a collection of annotated metabolite sets. MetSigDB includes classical pathway-metabolite sets, metabolite-receptor and metabolite-transporter sets, and chemical class-metabolite sets. In addition, MetaProViz enables the conversion of gene sets to metabolite sets by using enzyme-metabolic reaction associations. In addition, MetaProViz translates between metabolite identifiers of commonly used databases, analyzes mapping ambiguities and completes missing annotations. The MetaProViz functional analysis toolkit includes sample metadata analysis, classical enrichment analysis and biologically informed clustering. We showcase MetaProViz functionalities using kidney cancer metabolomics data from cell lines, cell-culture media, and tumour tissue. We found increased methionine usage in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines in line with decreased methionine levels in tumour samples. Further, we link this observation to enzymes and transporters crucial for overall survival in ccRCC and suggest that the increased methionine usage reflects the elevated DNA-hypermethylation landscape, a known characteristic in ccRCC. In summary, MetaProViz facilitates and improves the analysis and interpretation of metabolomics data.

MetDNA3	Multifunctional			Metabolite annotation in untargeted metabolomics remains challenging due to the vast structural diversity of metabolites. Network-based approaches have emerged as powerful strategies, particularly for annotating metabolites lacking chemical standards. Here, we develop a two-layer interactive networking topology that integrates data-driven and knowledge-driven networks to enhance metabolite annotation. A comprehensive metabolic reaction network is curated using graph neural network-based prediction of reaction relationships, enhancing both coverage and network connectivity. Experimental data are pre-mapped onto this network via sequential MS1 matching, reaction relationship mapping, and MS2 similarity constraints. The generated networking topology enables interactive annotation propagation with over 10-fold improved computational efficiency. In common biological samples, it annotates over 1600 seed metabolites with chemical standards and >12,000 putatively annotated metabolites through network-based propagation. Notably, two previously uncharacterized endogenous metabolites absent from human metabolome databases have been discovered. Overall, this strategy significantly improves the coverage, accuracy, and efficiency of metabolite annotation and is freely available as MetDNA3.

MetMiner, MDAtoolkits	Multifunctional			The utilization of metabolomics approaches to explore the metabolic mechanisms underlying plant fitness and adaptation to dynamic environments is growing, highlighting the need for an efficient and user-friendly toolkit tailored for analyzing the extensive datasets generated by metabolomics studies. Current protocols for metabolome data analysis often struggle with handling large-scale datasets or require programming skills. To address this, we present MetMiner (https://github.com/ShawnWx2019/MetMiner), a user-friendly, full-functionality pipeline specifically designed for plant metabolomics data analysis. Built on R shiny, MetMiner can be deployed on servers to utilize additional computational resources for processing large-scale datasets. MetMiner ensures transparency, traceability, and reproducibility throughout the analytical process. Its intuitive interface provides robust data interaction and graphical capabilities, enabling users without prior programming skills to engage deeply in data analysis. Additionally, we constructed and integrated a plant-specific mass spectrometry database into the MetMiner pipeline to optimize metabolite annotation. We have also developed MDAtoolkits, which include a complete set of tools for statistical analysis, metabolite classification, and enrichment analysis, to facilitate the mining of biological meaning from the datasets. Moreover, we propose an iterative weighted gene co-expression network analysis strategy for efficient biomarker metabolite screening in large-scale metabolomics data mining. In two case studies, we validated MetMiner's efficiency in data mining and robustness in metabolite annotation. Together, the MetMiner pipeline represents a promising solution for plant metabolomics analysis, providing a valuable tool for the scientific community to use with ease.

MS-DIAL 5	Multifunctional			Abstract Lipidomics and metabolomics communities comprise various informatics tools; however, software programs handling multimodal mass spectrometry (MS) data with structural annotations guided by the Lipidomics Standards Initiative are limited. Here, we provide MS-DIAL 5 for in-depth lipidome structural elucidation through electron-activated dissociation (EAD)-based tandem MS and determining their molecular localization through MS imaging (MSI) data using a species/tissue-specific lipidome database containing the predicted collision-cross section values. With the optimized EAD settings using 14 eV kinetic energy, the program correctly delineated lipid structures for 96.4% of authentic standards, among which 78.0% had the sn-, OH-, and/or C = C positions correctly assigned at concentrations exceeding 1 μM. We showcased our workflow by annotating the sn- and double-bond positions of eye-specific phosphatidylcholines containing very-long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (VLC-PUFAs), characterized as PC n-3-VLC-PUFA/FA. Using MSI data from the eye and n-3-VLC-PUFA-supplemented HeLa cells, we identified glycerol 3-phosphate acyltransferase as an enzyme candidate responsible for incorporating n-3 VLC-PUFAs into the sn1 position of phospholipids in mammalian cells, which was confirmed using EAD-MS/MS and recombinant proteins in a cell-free system. Therefore, the MS-DIAL 5 environment, combined with optimized MS data acquisition methods, facilitates a better understanding of lipid structures and their localization, offering insights into lipid biology.

MSOne	Multifunctional			Untargeted LC–MS metabolomics generates large, noisy datasets that demand complex, parameter-intensive workflows across multiple software tools. While over 5000 metabolomics datasets are available in public repositories, there are no reports on their re-analysis. Here, we report MSOne (https://msone.claritybiosystems.com), an AI-powered, vendor-agnostic, web-based software suite for end-to-end analysis of raw LC-MS data with minimal parameters. The overall workflow incorporates three modules: MetaExplorer for quality assessment and parameter optimization, MetAnalyzer for AI-assisted preprocessing and annotation, and MetaStat for statistical analysis and visualization. Within MetAnalyzer, mass spectra are first denoised and centroided using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for peak classification and a U-Net-based CNN for peak segmentation. Two other CNNs then repeat this step on chromatographic peaks to minimize the chromatographic noise. RANSAC-guided nonlinear retention-time alignment and graph-based peak grouping ensure robust feature definition, while a rule-driven and peak-to-peak correlation-based tagging classifies isotopes, adducts, and in-source fragments. MS/MS annotation (MSI level 2) applies frequency-based spectral denoising and a composite scoring scheme against public-domain libraries such as MS-DIAL, HMDB, GNPS, and LipidBlast. Benchmarking on public datasets demonstrates superior true-feature recovery, quantitation accuracy, and reproducibility compared to existing tools. A key feature of MSOne is the minimal demand for manual intervention. We have analyzed 80 public domain datasets (and growing) using MSOne, that have been made available in the public domain. Users can explore preprocessed data from MetaMine or submit new data for fresh analysis. MSOne is deployed in Google Cloud, a basic version of which will remain available free of cost to academic users.

NP3 MS Workflow	Multifunctional			Natural products (or specialized metabolites) are historically the main source of new drugs. However, the current drug discovery pipelines require miniaturization and speeds that are incompatible with traditional natural product research methods, especially in the early stages of the research. This article introduces the NP3 MS Workflow, a robust open-source software system for liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) untargeted metabolomic data processing and analysis, designed to rank bioactive natural products directly from complex mixtures of compounds, such as bioactive biota samples. NP3 MS Workflow allows minimal user intervention as well as customization of each step of LC–MS/MS data processing, with diagnostic statistics to allow interpretation and optimization of LC–MS/MS data processing by the user. NP3 MS Workflow adds improved computing of the MS2 spectra in an LC–MS/MS data set and provides tools for automatic [M + H]+ ion deconvolution using fragmentation rules; chemical structural annotation against MS2 databases; and relative quantification of the precursor ions for bioactivity correlation scoring. The software will be presented with case studies and comparisons with equivalent tools currently available. NP3 MS Workflow shows a robust and useful approach to select bioactive natural products from complex mixtures, improving the set of tools available for untargeted metabolomics. It can be easily integrated into natural product-based drug-discovery pipelines and to other fields of research at the interface of chemistry and biology.

OpenMS WebApps	Multifunctional			Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is an indispensable analytical technique in proteomics, metabolomics, and other life sciences. While OpenMS provides advanced open-source software for MS data analysis, its complexity can be challenging for nonexperts. To address this, we have developed OpenMS WebApps, a framework for creating user-friendly MS web applications based on the Streamlit Python package. OpenMS WebApps simplifies MS data analysis through an intuitive graphical user interface, interactive result visualizations, and support for both local and online execution. Key features include workspace management, automatic generation of input widgets, and parallel execution of tools, resulting in high performance and ready-to-use solutions for online and local deployment. This framework benefits both researchers and developers: scientists can focus on their research without the burden of complex software setups, and developers can rapidly create and distribute custom WebApps with novel algorithms. Several applications built on the OpenMS WebApps template demonstrate its utility across diverse MS-related fields, enhancing the OpenMS ecosystem for developers and a wider range of users. Furthermore, it integrates seamlessly with third-party software, extending its benefits to developers beyond the OpenMS community.

patRoon 2	Multifunctional			Non-target analysis (NTA) via chromatography coupled to high resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is used to monitor and identify organic chemicals in the environment. Biotic and abiotic processes can transform original chemicals (parents) into transformation products (TPs). These TPs can be of equal or more concern than their parent compounds and are therefore critical to monitor and identify in the environment (Escher & Fenner, 2011; Farré et al., 2008), often with NTA. Given the amount of data generated by NTA, advanced automated data processing workflows are essential. The open-source, R-based (R Core Team, 2021) platform patRoon (Helmus, ter Laak, et al., 2021) offers automated, straightforward, flexible and comprehensive NTA workflows. This article describes improvements introduced in patRoon 2.0, including extensive TP screen- ing and simultaneous processing of positive and negative HRMS data. The updated docu- mentation and code are available via https://rickhelmus.github.io/patRoon and archived in Helmus, Velde, et al.

POMAShiny	Multifunctional			Metabolomics and proteomics, like other omics domains, usually face a data mining challenge in providing an understandable output to advance in biomarker discovery and precision medicine. Often, statistical analysis is one of the most difficult challenges and it is critical in the subsequent biological interpretation of the results. Because of this, combined with the computational programming skills needed for this type of analysis, several bioinformatic tools aimed at simplifying metabolomics and proteomics data analysis have emerged. However, sometimes the analysis is still limited to a few hidebound statistical methods and to data sets with limited flexibility. POMAShiny is a web-based tool that provides a structured, flexible and user-friendly workflow for the visualization, exploration and statistical analysis of metabolomics and proteomics data. This tool integrates several statistical methods, some of them widely used in other types of omics, and it is based on the POMA R/Bioconductor package, which increases the reproducibility and flexibility of analyses outside the web environment. POMAShiny and POMA are both freely available at https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMAShiny and https://github.com/nutrimetabolomics/POMA, respectively.

Punc’data	Multifunctional			The increasing use of ultrahigh-resolution mass spectrometry to investigate complex organic mixtures by nontargeted analysis using mainly direct infusion requires developing specialized software tools and algorithms to aid in and accelerate calibration, data processing, and analysis. To address this need, Punc’data, a JavaScript tool usable on a webpage for mass spectrometry (MS) data attribution, visualization, and comparison, was developed. Molecular formula attribution is performed using a network approach, where mass differences can be defined by the user or de novo determined by the software. Following the attribution process, the results obtained are visualized using charts commonly employed to study complex organic mixtures such as class histograms, van Krevelen diagrams, and Kendrick maps. Alternatively, data processed by other software programs can be imported for graphical representation. Emphasis has been placed on an interactive chart system designed to identify trends of chemical significance within, unique or common to different data sets. The comparison of different data sets is facilitated through principal component analysis.

SLAW	Multifunctional			Metabolomics has been shown to be promising for diverse applications in basic, applied, and clinical research. These applications often require large-scale data, and while the technology to perform such experiments exists, downstream analysis remains challenging. Different tools exist in a variety of ecosystems, but they often do not scale to large data and are not integrated into a single coherent workflow. Moreover, the outcome of processing is very sensitive to a multitude of algorithmic parameters. Hence, parameter optimization is not only critical but also challenging. We present SLAW, a scalable and yet easy-to-use workflow for processing untargeted LC-MS data in metabolomics and lipidomics. The capabilities of SLAW include (1) state-of-the-art peak-picking algorithms, (2) a new automated parameter optimization routine, (3) an efficient sample alignment procedure, (4) gap filling by data recursion, and (5) the extraction of consolidated MS2 and an isotopic pattern across all samples. Importantly, both the workflow and the parameter optimization were designed for robust analysis of untargeted studies with thousands of individual LC-MSn runs. We compared SLAW to two state-of-the-art workflows based on openMS and XCMS. SLAW was able to detect and align more reproducible features in all data sets considered. SLAW scaled well, and its analysis of a data set with 2500 LC-MS files consumed 40% less memory and was 6 times faster than that using the XCMS-based workflow. SLAW also extracted 2-fold more isotopic patterns and MS2 spectra, which in 60% of the cases led to positive matches against a spectral library.

TidyMass	Multifunctional			Reproducibility, traceability, and transparency have been long-standing issues for metabolomics data analysis. Multiple tools have been developed, but limitations still exist. Here, we present the tidyMass project (https://www.tidymass.org/), a comprehensive R-based computational framework that can achieve the traceable, shareable, and reproducible workflow needs of data processing and analysis for LC-MS-based untargeted metabolomics. TidyMass is an ecosystem of R packages that share an underlying design philosophy, grammar, and data structure, which provides a comprehensive, reproducible, and object-oriented computational framework. The modular architecture makes tidyMass a highly flexible and extensible tool, which other users can improve and integrate with other tools to customize their own pipeline.

TidyMass2	Multifunctional			Untargeted metabolomics provides a direct window into biochemical activities but faces critical challenges in determining metabolite origins and interpreting unannotated metabolic features. Here, we present TidyMass2, an enhanced computational framework for Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS) untargeted metabolomics that addresses these limitations. TidyMass2 introduces three major innovations compared its predecessor, TidyMass: (1) a comprehensive metabolite origin inference capability that traces metabolites to human, microbial, dietary, pharmaceutical, and environmental sources through integration of 11 metabolite databases containing 532,488 metabolites with source information; (2) a metabolic feature-based functional module analysis approach that bypasses the annotation bottleneck by leveraging metabolic network topology to extract biological insights from unannotated metabolic features; and (3) an intuitive graphical interface that makes advanced metabolomics analyses accessible to researchers without programming expertise. Applied to longitudinal urine metabolomics data from human pregnancy, TidyMass2 identified diverse metabolites originating from human, microbiome, and environment, and uncovered 27 dysregulated metabolic modules. It increased the proportion of biologically interpretable metabolic features from 5.8% to 58.8%, revealing coordinated changes in steroid hormone biosynthesis, carbohydrate metabolism, and amino acid processing. By expanding biological interpretation beyond conventionally MS2 spectra-based annotated metabolites, TidyMass2 enables more comprehensive metabolic phenotyping while upholding strict open-source principles of reproducibility, traceability, and transparency.

TraceMetrix	Multifunctional			Metabolomics data analysis is a multifaceted process often constrained by limited data sharing and a lack of transparency, which hinders reproducibility of results. While existing bioinformatics tools address some of these challenges, achieving greater simplicity and operational clarity remains essential for fully leveraging the potential of metabolomics. Here, we introduce TraceMetrix, a web-based platform designed for interactive traceability in metabolomics data analysis. TraceMetrix provides a flexible management system for both raw and derived data, enabling comprehensive tracking of file origins and destinations throughout the whole analysis pipeline. The platform documents the software and parameters used across four key modules, from raw data preprocessing, data cleaning, statistical analysis to functional analysis, enabling users to easily track critical factors influencing result accuracy. By mapping upstream and downstream relationships for nearly 19 analytical functions, TraceMetrix ensures end-to-end traceability, viewable interactively online or exportable as detailed reports. To address the limitations of single-machine environments in processing large-scale datasets, TraceMetrix is deployed on a high-performance computing cluster for efficient batch processing. Using a non-targeted metabolomics dataset, we demonstrated its traceability function to optimize parameter selection, successfully reproducing the analysis process and validating the original study's findings. TraceMetrix integrates traceability across data, software, and processes, significantly enhancing reproducibility in metabolomics research. The platform supports diverse applications and is freely available at https://www.biosino.org/tracemetrix.

UmetaFlow	Multifunctional			Abstract Metabolomics experiments generate highly complex datasets, which are time and work-intensive, sometimes even error-prone if inspected manually. Therefore, new methods for automated, fast, reproducible, and accurate data processing and dereplication are required. Here, we present UmetaFlow, a computational workflow for untargeted metabolomics that combines algorithms for data pre-processing, spectral matching, molecular formula and structural predictions, and an integration to the GNPS workflows Feature-Based Molecular Networking and Ion Identity Molecular Networking for downstream analysis. UmetaFlow is implemented as a Snakemake workflow, making it easy to use, scalable, and reproducible. For more interactive computing, visualization, as well as development, the workflow is also implemented in Jupyter Notebook using the Python programming language and a set of Python bindings to the OpenMS algorithms (pyOpenMS). Finally, UmetaFlow is also offered as a web-based Graphical User Interface for parameter optimization and processing of smaller-sized datasets. UmetaFlow was validated with in-house LC–MS/MS datasets of actinomycetes producing known secondary metabolites, as well as commercial standards, and it detected all expected features and accurately annotated 76% of the molecular formulas and 65% of the structures. As a more generic validation, the publicly available MTBLS733 and MTBLS736 datasets were used for benchmarking, and UmetaFlow detected more than 90% of all ground truth features and performed exceptionally well in quantification and discriminating marker selection. We anticipate that UmetaFlow will provide a useful platform for the interpretation of large metabolomics datasets.

XCMS-METLIN	Multifunctional			Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based methods are essential in metabolomics, lipidomics, and chemical profiling, offering profound insights into biological systems and supporting advancements in fundamental biology, drug discovery, and personalized medicine (Heiles, 2021). Despite the realization that the metabolome plays an essential role in biology’s central dogma shaping cellular phenotype and function, the reliable identification of metabolites and chemical entities remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their integration into the expansive “omics” data landscape. To overcome this challenge, we have integrated the XCMS (eXtensible Computational Mass Spectrometry) data processing platform (Smith et al, 2006; Tautenhahn et al, 2012a) with the METLIN experimental MS/MS database (Smith et al, 2005; Tautenhahn et al, 2012a; Xue et al, 2020), which now hosts over 935,000 molecular standards. This integration marks a departure from platforms dependent on computationally derived molecular identifications, leveraging a data-driven approach that avoids speculative similarity networking based on in silico predictions. By enhancing the accuracy and scope of molecular identifications, the XCMS-METLIN platform not only strengthens data integrity but also paves the way for the incorporation of metabolomics into the realm of digital biology, thereby expanding its applicative potential across scientific disciplines.

AgeAnnoMO	Multiomics			Aging entails gradual functional decline influenced by interconnected factors. Multiple hallmarks proposed as common and conserved underlying denominators of aging on the molecular, cellular and systemic levels across multiple species. Thus, understanding the function of aging hallmarks and their relationships across species can facilitate the translation of anti-aging drug development from model organisms to humans. Here, we built AgeAnnoMO (https://relab.xidian.edu.cn/AgeAnnoMO/#/), a knowledgebase of multi-omics annotation for animal aging. AgeAnnoMO encompasses an extensive collection of 136 datasets from eight modalities, encompassing 8596 samples from 50 representative species, making it a comprehensive resource for aging and longevity research. AgeAnnoMO characterizes multiple aging regulators across species via multi-omics data, comprehensively annotating aging-related genes, proteins, metabolites, mitochondrial genes, microbiotas and age-specific TCR and BCR sequences tied to aging hallmarks for these species and tissues. AgeAnnoMO not only facilitates a deeper and more generalizable understanding of aging mechanisms, but also provides potential insights of the specificity across tissues and species in aging process, which is important to develop the effective anti-aging interventions for diverse populations. We anticipate that AgeAnnoMO will provide a valuable resource for comprehending and integrating the conserved driving hallmarks in aging biology and identifying the targetable biomarkers for aging research.

BATMAN‑TCM 2.0	Multiomics			Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) is increasingly recognized and utilized worldwide. However, the complex ingredients of TCM and their interactions with the human body make elucidating molecular mechanisms challenging, which greatly hinders the modernization of TCM. In 2016, we developed BATMAN-TCM 1.0, which is an integrated database of TCM ingredient–target protein interaction (TTI) for pharmacology research. Here, to address the growing need for a higher coverage TTI dataset, and using omics data to screen active TCM ingredients or herbs for complex disease treatment, we updated BATMAN-TCM to version 2.0 (http://bionet.ncpsb.org.cn/batman-tcm/). Using the same protocol as version 1.0, we collected 17 068 known TTIs by manual curation (with a 62.3-fold increase), and predicted ∼2.3 million high-confidence TTIs. In addition, we incorporated three new features into the updated version: (i) it enables simultaneous exploration of the target of TCM ingredient for pharmacology research and TCM ingredients binding to target proteins for drug discovery; (ii) it has significantly expanded TTI coverage; and (iii) the website was redesigned for better user experience and higher speed. We believe that BATMAN-TCM 2.0, as a discovery repository, will contribute to the study of TCM molecular mechanisms and the development of new drugs for complex diseases.

BnIR	Multiomics			In the post-genome-wide association study era, multi-omics techniques have shown great power and potential for candidate gene mining and functional genomics research. However, due to the lack of effective data integration and multi-omics analysis platforms, such techniques have not still been applied widely in rapeseed, an important oil crop worldwide. Here, we report a rapeseed multi-omics database (BnIR; http://yanglab.hzau.edu.cn/BnIR), which provides datasets of six omics including genomics, transcriptomics, variomics, epigenetics, phenomics, and metabolomics, as well as numerous “variation–gene expression–phenotype” associations by using multiple statistical methods. In addition, a series of multi-omics search and analysis tools are integrated to facilitate the browsing and application of these datasets. BnIR is the most comprehensive multi-omics database for rapeseed so far, and two case studies demonstrated its power to mine candidate genes associated with specific traits and analyze their potential regulatory mechanisms.

haCCA	Multiomics			Spatial techniques such as spatial transcriptomes and MALDI-MSI, offering insights into both transcripts and metabolite of tissue sections. However, integrating them with high accuracy is challenge due to no shared spots or features. We present haCCA, a workflow designed to integrate spatial transcriptomes and metabolomes data using high-correlated feature pairs and modified spatial morphological alignment. This approach ensures high-resolution and accurate spot-to-spot data integration across neighbor tissue section. We applied haCCA to both publicly available 10X Visium and MALDI-MSI datasets from mouse brain tissue and a custom spatial transcriptome and MALDI-MSI dataset from an intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) model, exploring the metabolic alteration of NETs(neutrophil extracellular traps) on ICC, and finding a potential mechanism that NETs upregulated Scd1 to activate fatty acid metabolism. Providing new insights into the dynamic crosstalk between genes and metabolites that regulates the tumor biological behavior and drives the response to treatment. We developed and published an easy-to-use Python package to facilitate its use.	haCCA: Multi-module Integrating of spatial transcriptomes and metabolomes	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2024.08.20.608773v2	bioRxiv	Shen, X.

HoloFoodR	Multiomics			Summary: Holo-omics is an emerging research area that integrates multi-omic datasets from the host organism and its microbiome to study their interactions. Recently, curated and openly accessible holo-omic databases have been developed. The HoloFood database, for instance, provides nearly 10,000 holo-omic profiles for salmon and chicken under controlled treatments. However, bridging the gap between holo-omic data resources and algorithmic frameworks remains a challenge. Combining the latest advances in statistical programming with curated holo-omic data sets can facilitate the design of open and reproducible research workflows in the emerging field of holo-omics.

INTEGRATE	Multiomics			Metabolism is directly and indirectly fine-tuned by a complex web of interacting regulatory mechanisms that fall into two major classes. On the one hand, the expression level of the catalyzing enzyme sets the maximal theoretical flux level (i.e., the net rate of the reaction) for each enzyme-controlled reaction. On the other hand, metabolic regulation controls the metabolic flux through the interactions of metabolites (substrates, cofactors, allosteric modulators) with the responsible enzyme. High-throughput data, such as metabolomics and transcriptomics data, if analyzed separately, do not accurately characterize the hierarchical regulation of metabolism outlined above. They must be integrated to disassemble the interdependence between different regulatory layers controlling metabolism. To this aim, we propose INTEGRATE, a computational pipeline that integrates metabolomics and transcriptomics data, using constraint-based stoichiometric metabolic models as a scaffold. We compute differential reaction expression from transcriptomics data and use constraint-based modeling to predict if the differential expression of metabolic enzymes directly originates differences in metabolic fluxes. In parallel, we use metabolomics to predict how differences in substrate availability translate into differences in metabolic fluxes. We discriminate fluxes regulated at the metabolic and/or gene expression level by intersecting these two output datasets. We demonstrate the pipeline using a set of immortalized normal and cancer breast cell lines. In a clinical setting, knowing the regulatory level at which a given metabolic reaction is controlled will be valuable to inform targeted, truly personalized therapies in cancer patients.

iTraNet	Multiomics			Motivation  Visualization and analysis of biological networks play crucial roles in understanding living systems. Biological networks include diverse types, from gene regulatory networks and protein–protein interactions to metabolic networks. Metabolic networks include substrates, products, and enzymes, which are regulated by allosteric mechanisms and gene expression. However, the analysis of these diverse omics types is challenging due to the diversity of databases and the complexity of network analysis. Results  We developed iTraNet, a web application that visualizes and analyses trans-omics networks involving four types of networks: gene regulatory networks, protein–protein interactions, metabolic networks, and metabolite exchange networks. Using iTraNet, we found that in wild-type mice, hub molecules within the network tended to respond to glucose administration, whereas in ob/ob mice, this tendency disappeared. With its ability to facilitate network analysis, we anticipate that iTraNet will help researchers gain insights into living systems.

jMorp	Multiomics			Modern medicine is increasingly focused on personalized medicine, and multi-omics data is crucial in understanding biological phenomena and disease mechanisms. Each ethnic group has its unique genetic background with specific genomic variations influencing disease risk and drug response. Therefore, multi-omics data from specific ethnic populations are essential for the effective implementation of personalized medicine. Various prospective cohort studies, such as the UK Biobank, All of Us and Lifelines, have been conducted worldwide. The Tohoku Medical Megabank project was initiated after the Great East Japan Earthquake in 2011. It collects biological specimens and conducts genome and omics analyses to build a basis for personalized medicine. Summary statistical data from these analyses are available in the jMorp web database (https://jmorp.megabank.tohoku.ac.jp), which provides a multidimensional approach to the diversity of the Japanese population. jMorp was launched in 2015 as a public database for plasma metabolome and proteome analyses and has been continuously updated. The current update will significantly expand the scale of the data (metabolome, genome, transcriptome, and metagenome). In addition, the user interface and backend server implementations were rewritten to improve the connectivity between the items stored in jMorp. This paper provides an overview of the new version of the jMorp.	jMorp: Japanese Multi-Omics Reference Panel update report 2023	https://academic.oup.com/nar/article/52/D1/D622/7335743	Nucleic Acids Research	Tadaka, S., Kawashima, J., Hishinuma, E., Saito, S., Okamura, Y., Otsuki, A., Kojima, K., Komaki, S., Aoki, Y., Kanno, T., Saigusa, D., Inoue, J., Shirota, M., Takayama, J., Katsuoka, F., Shimizu, A., Tamiya, G., Shimizu, R., Hiratsuka, M., Motoike, I.

MetaNet	Multiomics			Network analysis is a powerful strategy for uncovering complex relationships in high-throughput omics datasets. However, current tools often lack scalability, flexibility, and native support for multi-omics integration, posing significant barriers for exploring complex biological networks. To address these limitations, we developed MetaNet, a high-performance R package designed to construct, visualize, and analyze biological networks from multi-omics datasets. MetaNet supports highly efficient correlation-based network construction, scalable to datasets with over 10,000 features, and includes extensive layout algorithms and visualization options compatible with both static and interactive platforms. It also provides a comprehensive suite of topological and stability metrics for in-depth network characterization. Benchmarking results show that MetaNet outperforms existing R packages by up to 100-fold in computation time and reduces memory usage by up to 50-fold. We demonstrate its utility through two case studies: (1) a longitudinal analysis of microbial co-occurrence networks showing the dynamics of the airborne microbiome, and (2) an integrative exposome–transcriptome network of more than 40,000 features, uncovering distinct regulatory impacts of biological and chemical exposures. MetaNet bridges the gap between network theory and omics application by offering a robust, reproducible, and biologically informed framework for large-scale, interpretable, and integrative network analyses across diverse omics platforms, advancing systems-level understanding in modern life sciences. MetaNet is available on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/MetaNet).

MiMeNet	Multiomics			The advance in microbiome and metabolome studies has generated rich omics data revealing the involvement of the microbial community in host disease pathogenesis through interactions with their host at a metabolic level. However, the computational tools to uncover these relationships are just emerging. Here, we present MiMeNet, a neural network framework for modeling microbe-metabolite relationships. Using ten iterations of 10-fold cross-validation on three paired microbiome-metabolome datasets, we show that MiMeNet more accurately predicts metabolite abundances (mean Spearman correlation coefficients increase from 0.108 to 0.309, 0.276 to 0.457, and -0.272 to 0.264) and identifies more well-predicted metabolites (increase in the number of well-predicted metabolites from 198 to 366, 104 to 143, and 4 to 29) compared to state-of-art linear models for individual metabolite predictions. Additionally, we demonstrate that MiMeNet can group microbes and metabolites with similar interaction patterns and functions to illuminate the underlying structure of the microbe-metabolite interaction network, which could potentially shed light on uncharacterized metabolites through “Guilt by Association”. Our results demonstrated that MiMeNet is a powerful tool to provide insights into the causes of metabolic dysregulation in disease, facilitating future hypothesis generation at the interface of the microbiome and metabolomics.

Multi-omics data on alfalfa continue to accumulate owing to recent advances in high-throughput techniques, and integrating this information holds great potential for expediting genetic research and facilitating advances in alfalfa agronomic traits. Therefore, we developed a comprehensive database named MODMS (multi-omics database of M. sativa) that incorporates multiple reference genomes, annotations, comparative genomics, transcriptomes, high-quality genomic variants, proteomics, and metabolomics. This report describes our continuously evolving database, which provides researchers with several convenient tools and extensive omics data resources, facilitating the expansion of alfalfa research.

MultiOmicsIntegrator	Multiomics			Motivation Analysis of gene and isoform expression levels is becoming critical for the detailed understanding of biochemical mechanisms. In addition, integrating RNA-seq data with other omics data types, such as proteomics and metabolomics, provides a strong approach for consolidating our understanding of biological processes across various organizational tiers, thus promoting the identification of potential therapeutic targets. Results  We present our pipeline, called MultiOmicsIntegrator (MOI), an inclusive pipeline for comprehensive omics analyses. MOI represents a unified approach that performs in-depth individual analyses of diverse omics. Specifically, exhaustive analysis of RNA-seq data at the level of genes, isoforms of genes, as well as miRNA is offered, coupled with functional annotation and structure prediction of these transcripts. Additionally, proteomics and metabolomics data are supported providing a holistic view of biological systems. Finally, MOI has tools to integrate simultaneously multiple and diverse omics datasets, with both data- and function-driven approaches, fostering a deeper understanding of intricate biological interactions.

Omics Dashboard	Multiomics			The Omics Dashboard is a software tool for interactive exploration and analysis of metabolomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, and multi-omics datasets. Organized as a hierarchy of cellular systems, the Dashboard at its highest level contains graphical panels for the full range of cellular systems, including biosynthesis, energy metabolism, and response to stimulus. Thus, the Dashboard top level surveys the state of the cell across a broad range of key systems in a single screen. Each Dashboard panel contains a series of X–Y plots depicting the aggregated omics data values relevant to different subsystems of that panel, e.g., subsystems within the biosynthesis panel include amino acid biosynthesis, carbohydrate biosynthesis and cofactor biosynthesis. Users can interactively drill down to focus in on successively lower-level subsystems of interest. In this article, we present for the first time the metabolomics analysis capabilities of the Omics Dashboard, along with significant new extensions to better accommodate metabolomics datasets, enable analysis and visualization of multi-omics datasets, and provide new data-filtering options.

OmicsNet 2.0	Multiomics			Researchers are increasingly seeking to interpret molecular data within a multi-omics context to gain a more comprehensive picture of their study system. OmicsNet (www.omicsnet.ca) is a web-based tool developed to allow users to easily build, visualize, and analyze multi-omics networks to study rich relationships among lists of ‘omics features of interest. Three major improvements have been introduced in OmicsNet 2.0, which include: (i) enhanced network visual analytics with eleven 2D graph layout options and a novel 3D module layout; (ii) support for three new ‘omics types: single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) list from genetic variation studies; taxon list from microbiome profiling studies, as well as liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) peaks from untargeted metabolomics; and (iii) measures to improve research reproducibility by coupling R command history with the release of the companion OmicsNetR package, and generation of persistent links to share interactive network views. We performed a case study using the multi-omics data obtained from a recent large-scale investigation on inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and demonstrated that OmicsNet was able to quickly create meaningful multi-omics context to facilitate hypothesis generation and mechanistic insights.

SOmicsFusion	Multiomics		Yes	We present SOmicsFusion, a software toolbox for ’fusing’ spatial omics with classical biomedical imaging modalities, capitalizing on their inherent correspondences and complementarity when characterizing the same subject. By augmenting radiological and histological images with spatially resolved molecular profiling, this fusion offers a panoramic characterization of the biochemical perturbations underlying pathological conditions, thereby advancing our understanding of diseases like brain disorders and cancers. The cornerstone of SOmicsFusion is a coregistration tool that leverages an innovative two-stage machine learning pipeline to tackle the longstanding challenge of spatially aligning data from fundamentally different modalities, priming them for subsequent fusion analysis that often requires precise pixel-wise correspondence between the datasets. Specifically, the pipeline utilizes an original dimension reduction algorithm for representational domain alignment, followed by a Deep Learning-based method for spatial domain alignment. SOmicsFusion is demonstrated using mass spectrometry imaging (MSI)-mediated spatial metabolomics and four other modalities: magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), microscopy, brain atlas, and spatial transcriptomics. By reducing coregistration errors by 38–69% compared to existing pipelines, SOmicsFusion enhances the precision of associating molecule distribution with anatomy and pathology features, ultimately leading to more statistically robust findings. Furthermore, SOmicsFusion incorporates various downstream analysis tools, including overlay visualization, spatial correlation/co-expression analysis, pansharpening, and automated anatomy annotation. These tools facilitate the extraction of biological insights that would be unattainable through individual modalities alone. For instance, the coregistration and correlation between MSI and in vivo MRI datasets unveil that the spatial heterogeneity in metabolites stems from the temporal heterogeneity in the development of cerebral ischemia-reperfusion injury.

SVAtlas	Multiomics			Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are nanoscale particles released by cells, carrying proteins, nucleic acids, lipids, and metabolites. These vesicles mediate intercellular communication and modulate disease progression across various conditions. Owing to their molecular heterogeneity and the stable bilayer protecting their cargo, EVs serve as valuable tools for early disease detection and personalized therapies. However, traditional bulk EV studies aggregate data, which can mask the distinct molecular profiles of individual EVs critical for targeted diagnostics and treatments, diminishing diagnostic precision. Recent advances in single-EV analysis, leveraging high-resolution sequencing and imaging technologies, have revealed unique molecular signatures. However, a comprehensive database integrating multi-omics data from single EVs remains lacking. To address this, we developed SVAtlas, the first database dedicated to integrating single-EV datasets (2015–2025). SVAtlas incorporates 8120 protein entries, 106 RNA entries (miRNA, mRNA, circRNA, and lncRNA), 2 DNA entries, and 8 lipid/metabolite entries across 276 EV projects, spanning 31 diseases, 32 tissues/organs, and 10 biofluids from five species. SVAtlas offers single-EV datasets with experimental parameters, heterogeneity analyses, disease-specific marker exploration, built-in analysis/clustering/visualization pipelines, and an LLM-based question-answering tool, empowering researchers to explore single-EV omics in detail. Free and accessible at https://www.svatlas.org/, SVAtlas accelerates the clinical translation of single-EV analysis and biomarker discovery.

TurbOmics	Multiomics			In recent years, multi-omics integration has proven highly effective for the holistic characterization of biological systems, with the development of numerous bioinformatic platforms. However, these tools face limitations when incorporating metabolomics data, including absence of support for untargeted metabolomics annotation and dependence on predefined knowledge bases. Furthermore, the advanced algorithms required for multi-omics integration typically demand programming skills and statistical background, restricting their use to specialized users. To advance towards resolving these challenges, we present TurbOmics, a user-friendly web-based platform that enables researchers with diverse backgrounds to analyze metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics data using advanced algorithms for multi-omics integration, while addressing key challenges associated with metabolomics data. Users can upload quantitative data and include additional information, such as metabolite identification or lipid classes, that streamline the interpretation of complex results. TurbOmics can be used sequentially with our previously published tool, TurboPutative, to simplify, reduce and prioritize the list of putative annotations from untargeted metabolomics datasets. Thanks to its flexible and interactive interface, researchers can perform exploratory data analysis and multi-omics integration using the Multi-Omics Factor Analysis, Pathway Integrative Analysis and Enrichment Analysis modules. We believe that TurbOmics will make multi-omics analysis more accessible to the research community. The platform is freely available at https://proteomics.cnic.es/TurboPutative/TurbOmicsApp.html.

TurboPutative	Multiomics			Untargeted metabolomics aims at measuring the entire set of metabolites in a wide range of biological samples. However, due to the high chemical diversity of metabolites that range from small to large and more complex molecules (i.e., amino acids/carbohydrates vs. phospholipids/gangliosides), the identification and characterization of the metabolome remain a major bottleneck. The first step of this process consists of searching the experimental monoisotopic mass against databases, thus resulting in a highly redundant/complex list of candidates. Despite the progress in this area, researchers are still forced to manually explore the resulting table in order to prioritize the most likely identifications for further biological interpretation or confirmation with standards. Here, we present TurboPutative (https://proteomics.cnic.es/TurboPutative/), a flexible and user-friendly web-based platform composed of four modules (Tagger, REname, RowMerger, and TPMetrics) that streamlines data handling, classification, and interpretability of untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomics data. Tagger classifies the different compounds and provides preliminary insights into the biological system studied. REname improves putative annotation handling and visualization, allowing the recognition of isomers and equivalent compounds and redundant data removal. RowMerger reduces the dataset size, facilitating the manual comparison among annotations. Finally, TPMetrics combines different datasets with feature intensity and relevant information for the researcher and calculates a score based on adduct probability and feature correlations, facilitating further identification, assessment, and interpretation of the results. The TurboPutative web application allows researchers in the metabolomics field that are dealing with massive datasets containing multiple putative annotations to reduce the number of these entries by 80%–90%, thus facilitating the extrapolation of biological knowledge and improving metabolite prioritization for subsequent pathway analysis. TurboPutative comprises a rapid, automated, and customizable workflow that can also be included in programmed bioinformatics pipelines through its RESTful API services. Users can explore the performance of each module through demo datasets supplied on the website. The platform will help the metabolomics community to speed up the arduous task of manual data curation that is required in the first steps of metabolite identification, improving the generation of biological knowledge.

iSODA	Multiomics/Visualization			Thanks to the plummeting costs of continuously evolving omics analytical platforms, research centers collect multiomics data more routinely. They are, however, confronted with the lack of a versatile software solution to harmoniously analyze single-omics and interpret multiomics data. We have developed iSODA, a web-based application for the analysis of single- and multiomics data. The tool emphasizes intuitive interactive visualizations designed for user-driven data exploration. Researchers can access a variety of functions ranging from simple visualization like volcano plots and PCA to advanced functional analyses like enrichment analysis and lipid saturation analysis. For integrated multiomics, iSODA incorporates multi-omics factor analysis and similarity network fusion. The ability to adapt the data on-the-fly allows for tasks, such as the removal of outlier samples or failed features, imputation, or normalization. All results are presented through interactive plots, the modular design supports extensions, and tooltips and tutorials provide comprehensive guidance for users. iSODA is accessible under http://isoda.online/. 	iSODA: A Comprehensive Tool for Integrative Omics Data Analysis in Single- and Multi-Omics Experiments	https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/39886798/	Analytical Chemistry	Olivier‑Jimenez, D., Derks, R.

Here, we introduce OmicsAnalyst, a user-friendly, web-based platform that allows users to perform a wide range of well-established data-driven approaches for multi-omics integration, and visually explore their results in a clear and meaningful manner. To help navigate complex landscapes of multi-omics analysis, these approaches are organized into three visual analytics tracks: (i) the correlation network analysis track, where users choose among univariate and multivariate methods to identify important features and explore their relationships in 2D or 3D networks; (ii) the cluster heatmap analysis track, where users apply several cutting-edge multi-view clustering algorithms and explore their results via interactive heatmaps; and (iii) the dimension reduction analysis track, where users choose among several recent multivariate techniques to reveal global data structures, and explore corresponding scores, loadings and biplots in interactive 3D scatter plots. The three visual analytics tracks are equipped with comprehensive options for parameter customization, view customization and targeted analysis.

Metaboverse	Specialized			Metabolism is intertwined with various cellular processes, including controlling cell fate, influencing tumorigenesis, participating in stress responses and more. Metabolism is a complex, interdependent network, and local perturbations can have indirect effects that are pervasive across the metabolic network. Current analytical and technical limitations have long created a bottleneck in metabolic data interpretation. To address these shortcomings, we developed Metaboverse, a user-friendly tool to facilitate data exploration and hypothesis generation. Here we introduce algorithms that leverage the metabolic network to extract complex reaction patterns from data. To minimize the impact of missing measurements within the network, we introduce methods that enable pattern recognition across multiple reactions. Using Metaboverse, we identify a previously undescribed metabolite signature that correlated with survival outcomes in early stage lung adenocarcinoma patients. Using a yeast model, we identify metabolic responses suggesting an adaptive role of citrate homeostasis during mitochondrial dysfunction facilitated by the citrate transporter, Ctp1. We demonstrate that Metaboverse augments the user’s ability to extract meaningful patterns from multi-omics datasets to develop actionable hypotheses.

MODAPro	Specialized		Yes	The rapid growth of multiomics data has revolutionized our ability to investigate disease mechanisms, yet significant challenges persist in achieving meaningful integration due to inherent data heterogeneity, characteristic sparsity patterns, and the persistent interpretability gap in current analytical approaches. To address these critical limitations, we introduce MODAPro, a biologically informed deep learning framework that synergistically integrates variational graph autoencoders (VAE) with graph convolutional networks (GCN). This novel architecture enables MODAPro to capture and meaningfully interpret complex, nonlinear molecular relationships across different omics layers with unprecedented resolution. Through systematic benchmarking across diverse disease-related data sets, MODAPro consistently outperforms existing approaches in identifying disease-associated biomarkers and functionally coherent modules. Importantly, MODAPro reveals latent biomolecular information that is often missed by conventional methods. In realistic and challenging scenarios, MODAPro effectively captures intricate across–omic interactions, enhancing functional annotation and offering new insights into disease from a systems biology perspective, bridging a critical gap between computational analysis and biological understanding. Furthermore, MODAPro retains robust performance on single-omics data sets by leveraging the multiomics context, facilitating discovery even from sparse or incomplete data. The framework’s adaptability to various data types and conditions makes it particularly valuable for precision medicine applications, where it can uncover actionable disease signatures and regulatory networks that would otherwise remain undetected. By effectively addressing the major challenges in multiomics integration, MODAPro provides a useful approach for systems biology research and translational medicine. The source code of MODAPro is publicly available in our GitHub repository: https://github.com/zhaoxiaoqi0714/MODAPro.

A-SIMA/A-MAP	NMR			Introduction Metabolomics is the comprehensive study of small molecules in biological systems. It has recently garnered attention for its wide variety of applications such as diseases, drug treatments, agriculture, and more. As the interest in metabolomics grow, meeting the demands of cutting-edge research requires software tools that not only advance analytical capabilities, but also prioritize user-friendly features. Objectives  In response to this need, we present two new computer programs, A-SIMA: Advanced-Software for Interactive Metabolite Analysis and A-MAP: A Multivariate Analysis Program. These tools aim to introduce new capabilities for metabolite identification and data analysis, and thereby advancing the computational methodology in NMR-based metabolomics. Methods  A-SIMA is designed with an easy-to-use graphical user interface which allows users to perform metabolite identification on 1D and 2D NMR data effortlessly with complete control over the identification process. Similarly, A-MAP facilitates multivariate statistical analysis of metabolite data through a straightforward process. It offers analysis options such as Principal Component Analysis and Orthogonal Partial Least Squares-Discriminant Analysis using regions of interests as inputs. Results  Both A-SIMA and A-MAP are pre-built in the POKY suite, available at https://poky.clas.ucdenver.edu, with tutorial videos on YouTube for guidance on not only the programs, but also installation. The POKY suite is a software program for NMR biomolecular analysis. With the addition of these programs in POKY, researchers and professionals can experience a fully integrated process for every step of their metabolite analysis. Data can also be easily exported from these programs to be applied elsewhere. Conclusion  The introduction of A-SIMA and A-MAP can be promising tools that can lead significant advancements in metabolomics research. These tools offer enhanced capabilities for metabolite analysis and statistical modelling in a user-friendly manner. Their integration into the POKY suite ensures accessibility, usability, and efficiency.

AQuA	NMR			Abstract   Introduction   The Automated Quantification Algorithm (AQuA) is a rapid and efficient method for targeted NMR-based metabolomics, currently optimised for blood plasma. AQuA quantifies metabolites from 1D-1H NMR spectra based on the height of only one signal per metabolite, which minimises the computational time and workload of the method without compromising the quantification accuracy.      Objectives   To develop a fast and computationally efficient extension of AQuA for quantification of selected metabolites in highly complex samples, with minimal prior sample preparation. In particular, the method should be capable of handling interferences caused by broad background signals.      Methods   An automatic baseline correction function was combined with AQuA into an automated workflow, the extended AQuA, for quantification of metabolites in plant root exudate NMR spectra that contained broad background signals and baseline distortions. The approach was evaluated using simulations as well as a spike-in experiment in which known metabolite amounts were added to a complex sample matrix.      Results   The extended AQuA enables accurate quantification of metabolites in 1D-1H NMR spectra with varying complexity. The method is very fast (&lt; 1 s per spectrum) and can be fully automated.      Conclusions   The extended AQuA is an automated quantification method intended for 1D-1H NMR spectra containing broad background signals and baseline distortions. Although the method was developed for plant root exudates, it should be readily applicable to any NMR spectra displaying similar issues as it is purely computational and applied to NMR spectra post-acquisition.

ASICS	NMR			Metabolomics is a promising approach to characterize phenotypes or to identify biomarkers. It is also easily accessible through NMR, which can provide a comprehensive understanding of the metabolome of any living organisms. However, the analysis of 1H NMR spectrum remains difficult, mainly due to the different problems encountered to perform automatic identification and quantification of metabolites in a reproducible way. In addition, methods that perform automatic identification and quantification of metabolites are often designed to process one given complex mixture spectrum at a time. Hence, when a set of complex mixture spectra coming from the same experiment has to be processed, the approach is simply repeated independently for every spectrum, despite their resemblance. Here, we present new methods that are the first to either align spectra or to identify and quantify metabolites by integrating information coming from several complex spectra of the same experiment. The performances of these new methods are then evaluated on both simulated and real datasets. The results show an improvement in the metabolite identification and in the accuracy of metabolite quantifications, especially when the concentration is low. This joint procedure is available in version 2.0 of ASICS package.

Bucket Fuser	NMR			Untargeted metabolomics is a promising tool for identifying novel disease biomarkers and unraveling underlying pathomechanisms. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is particularly suited for large-scale untargeted metabolomics studies due to its high reproducibility and cost effectiveness. Here, one-dimensional (1D) 1H NMR experiments offer good sensitivity at reasonable measurement times. Their subsequent data analysis requires sophisticated data preprocessing steps, including the extraction of NMR features corresponding to specific metabolites. We developed a novel 1D NMR feature extraction procedure, called Bucket Fuser (BF), which is based on a regularized regression framework with fused group LASSO terms. The performance of the BF procedure was demonstrated using three independent NMR datasets and was benchmarked against existing state-of-the-art NMR feature extraction methods. BF dynamically constructs NMR metabolite features, the widths of which can be adjusted via a regularization parameter. BF consistently improved metabolite signal extraction, as demonstrated by our correlation analyses with absolutely quantified metabolites. It also yielded a higher proportion of statistically significant metabolite features in our differential metabolite analyses. The BF algorithm is computationally efficient and it can deal with small sample sizes. In summary, the Bucket Fuser algorithm, which is available as a supplementary python code, facilitates the fast and dynamic extraction of 1D NMR signals for the improved detection of metabolic biomarkers.

CASMDB 	NMR			Databases are invaluable for the identification of individual metabolites in untargeted metabolomics analyses, providing annotated pure metabolite references that allow for comparisons with experimentally collected mixture samples. Despite the value of an extensive reference database, publicly available databases for NMR-based metabolomics are often incomplete with respect to experimental conditions and derived NMR annotation parameters, such as peak positions. Hence, they are not designed for visualising the reference spectra alongside an experimental sample spectrum of interest, thus limiting the usefulness of the database. As a consequence, researchers have resorted to their own user- or application based database implementations.    In this paper we describe the collection, remediation and integration of annotation data from the publicly available HMDB, BRMB and GISMO NMR metabolomics databases to build the CcpNmr Analysis Simulated Metabolomics Database (CASMDB) that contains 1932 unique metabolite entries. This database, in concert with the AnalysisMetabolomics programme, also allows or accurate simulation of spectra at arbitrary field strengths. Together, these tools underpin the visualising of experimental and simulated metabolite references and their usage in 1D 1H NMR-based metabolomics studies.

COLMAR1d	NMR			The field of metabolomics, which is quintessential in today’s omics research, involves the large-scale detection, identification, and quantification of small-molecule metabolites in a wide range of biological samples. Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has emerged as a powerful tool for metabolomics due to its high resolution, reproducibility, and exceptional quantitative nature. One of the key bottlenecks of metabolomics studies, however, remains the accurate and automated analysis of the resulting NMR spectra with good accuracy and minimal human intervention. Here, we present the COLMAR1d platform, consisting of a public web server and an optimized database, for one-dimensional (1D) NMR-based metabolomics analysis to address these challenges. The COLMAR1d database comprises more than 480 metabolites from GISSMO enabling a database query of spectra measured at arbitrary magnetic field strengths, as is demonstrated for spectra acquired between 1H resonance frequencies of 80 MHz and 1.2 GHz of mouse serum, DMEM cell growth medium, and wine. COLMAR1d combines the GISSMO metabolomics database concept with the latest tools for automated processing, spectral deconvolution, database querying, and globally optimized mixture analysis for improved accuracy and efficiency. By leveraging advanced computational algorithms, COLMAR1d offers a user-friendly, automated platform for quantitative 1D NMR-based metabolomics analysis allowing a wide range of applications, including biomarker discovery, metabolic pathway elucidation, and integration with multiomics strategies.

COLMARppm	NMR			Despite rapid progress in metabolomics research, a major bottleneck is the large number of metabolites whose chemical structures are unknown or whose spectra have not been deposited in metabolomics databases. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has a long history of elucidating chemical structures from experimentally measured 1H and 13C chemical shifts. One approach to characterizing the chemical structures of an unknown metabolite is to predict the 1H and 13C chemical shifts of candidate compounds (e.g., metabolites from the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB)) and compare them with chemical shifts of the unknown. However, accurate prediction of NMR chemical shifts in aqueous solution is challenging due to limitations of experimental chemical shift libraries and the high computational cost of quantum chemical methods. To improve NMR prediction accuracy and applicability, an empirical prediction strategy is introduced here to provide an accurately predicted chemical shift for organic molecules and metabolites within seconds. Unique features of COLMARppm include (i) the training library exclusively consisting of high quality NMR spectra measured under standard conditions in aqueous solution, (ii) utilization of NMR motif information, and (iii) leveraging of the improved prediction accuracy for the automated assignment of experimental chemical shifts for candidate structures. COLMARppm is demonstrated in terms of accuracy and speed for a set of 20 compounds taken from the HMDB for chemical shift prediction and resonance assignment. COLMARppm is applicable to a wide range of small molecules and can be directly incorporated into metabolomics workflows.

COLMARvista	NMR			Abstract   COLMARvista is presented as a new, highly versatile software for the easy and intuitive processing and visual inspection of 2D and pseudo-3D NMR data both for uniformly and non-uniformly sampled datasets. COLMARvista allows fully autonomous processing of spectra, including zero-filling, apodization, water suppression, Fourier transformation, and phase correction. Its full integration with DEEP Picker and Voigt Fitter programs allows the automated deconvolution and reconstruction of the experimental spectra for highly quantitative analysis, from compound concentration determination to the extraction of cross-peak specific relaxation parameters, even for signals affected by significant overlap with other peaks. COLMARvista is based on JavaScript and, hence, it is computer-architecture and operating-system independent including its advanced graphics. It runs on all recent web browsers and does not require a potentially elaborate operating-system dependent installation. COLMARvista may serve as a paradigm also for other software projects to prevent the stockpiling of once powerful legacy software that became frozen in time, thereby ensuring continuing progress of the NMR field and its software for future generations of NMR spectroscopists.

CRAFT 	NMR			Background: There are a few very specific inflammation biomarkers in blood, namely lipoprotein NMe+ signals of protein clusters (GlycA and GlycB) and a composite resonance of phospholipids (SPC). The relative integrals of these resonances provide clear indication of the unique metabolic changes associated with disease, specifically inflammatory conditions, often related to serious diseases such as cancer or COVID-19 infection. Relatively complicated, yet very efficient experimental methods have been introduced recently (DIRE, JEDI) to suppress the rest of the spectrum, thus allowing measurement of these integrals of interest. Methods: In this study, we introduce a simple alternative processing method using CRAFT (Complete Reduction to Amplitude-Frequency Table), a time-domain (FID) analysis tool which can highlight selected subsets of the spectrum by choice for quantitative analysis. The output of this approach is a direct, spreadsheet-based representation of the required peak amplitude (integral) values, ready for comparative analysis, completely avoiding all the convectional data processing and manipulation steps. The significant advantage of this alternative method is that it only needs a simple water-suppressed 1D spectrum with no further experimental manipulation whatsoever. In addition, there are no pre/post processing steps (such as baseline and/or phase), further minimizing potential dependency on subjective decisions by the user and providing an opportunity to automate the entire process. Results: We applied this methodology to horse serum samples to follow the presence of inflammation for cohorts with or without OCD (Osteochondritis Dissecans) conditions and find diagnostic separation of the of the cohorts through statistical methods. Conclusions: The powerful and simple CRAFT-based approach is suitable to extract selected biomarker information from complex NMR spectra and can be similarly applied to any other biofluid from any source or sample, also retrospectively. There is a potential to extend such a simple analysis to other, previously identified relevant markers as well.

CReSS	NMR			Library matching using carbon-13 nuclear magnetic resonance (13C NMR) spectra has been a popular method adopted in compound identification systems. However, the usability of existing approaches has been restricted as enlarging a library containing both a chemical structure and spectrum is a costly and time-consuming process. Therefore, we propose a fundamentally different, novel approach to match 13C NMR spectra directly against a molecular structure library. We develop a cross-modal retrieval between spectrum and structure (CReSS) system using deep contrastive learning, which allows us to search a molecular structure library using the 13C NMR spectrum of a compound. In the test of searching 41,494 13C NMR spectra against a reference structure library containing 10.4 million compounds, CReSS reached a recall@10 accuracy of 91.64% and a processing speed of 0.114 s per query spectrum. When further incorporating a filter with a molecular weight tolerance of 5 Da, CReSS achieved a new remarkable recall@10 of 98.39%. Furthermore, CReSS has potential in detecting scaffolds of novel structures and demonstrates great performance for the task of structural revision. CReSS is built and developed to bridge the gap between 13C NMR spectra and structures and could be generally applicable in compound identification.

DeepSAT	NMR			The identification of molecular structure is essential for understanding chemical diversity and for developing drug leads from small molecules. Nevertheless, the structure elucidation of small molecules by Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) experiments is often a long and non-trivial process that relies on years of training. To achieve this process efficiently, several spectral databases have been established to retrieve reference NMR spectra. However, the number of reference NMR spectra available is limited and has mostly facilitated annotation of commercially available derivatives. Here, we introduce DeepSAT, a neural network-based structure annotation and scaffold prediction system that directly extracts the chemical features associated with molecular structures from their NMR spectra. Using only the 1H-13C HSQC spectrum, DeepSAT identifies related known compounds and thus efficiently assists in the identification of molecular structures. DeepSAT is expected to accelerate chemical and biomedical research by accelerating the identification of molecular structures.

InRA	NMR			Background The extraction of relevant information from proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1H NMR) spectra through preprocessing and multivariate analysis requires integrating multiple software tools and extensive manual intervention, compromising efficiency and reproducibility when the technique is used. Consequently, the development of automated, versatile, and reliable methodologies has become imperative to streamline workflows, improve analytical performance, and broaden the applicability of multivariate methods for the analysis of diverse sample types and experimental conditions. Results This work presents the development and application of Interval Resonance Analysis (InRA), an alternative software tool focused on 1H NMR multivariate analysis. InRA includes a novel algorithm for resonance signal detection (intervals), specifically designed to operate with flexibility across diverse 1H NMR spectra. All intervals are integrated using multivariate curve resolution with alternating least squares (MCR–ALS) and analyzed by exploratory analysis. The performance of InRA was tested by evaluating the 1H NMR spectra of hydrophilic sugar beet root extracts cultivated in three different fields and their discrimination by partial least squares – discriminant analysis (PLS–DA). The workflow provided by InRA yielded consistent results regarding the distribution of samples according to their field, enabling the identification of subtle sources of variation and achieving classification accuracies ≥ 88.9 %. Significance The proposed methodology represents an advancement in the multivariate analysis of 1H NMR spectra for untargeted studies and enhances analytical efficiency by reducing manual intervention and reliance on analyst experience. InRA is versatile and can be applied to various sample types and analytical objectives, as it is not restricted by specific experimental conditions.

LAMAIS	NMR			Background One-dimensional proton nuclear magnetic resonance (1D 1H NMR) spectroscopy is a non-destructive, non-targeted analytical technique providing both qualitative and quantitative insights, particularly beneficial for mixture analysis. However, the qualitative analysis of 1D 1H NMR spectra for mixture samples is laborious and time-consuming, involving extensive database searches and verification experiments like spiking. This process heavily relies on the analyst's expertise, leading to efficiency discrepancies. There is a pressing need for a reliable method to streamline operations and enhance the efficiency of qualitative analysis in complex mixtures. Results We introduce a library-aided method for spectral profiling, named LAMAIS. This method achieves compound identification through similarity assessment between samples and template data, allowing rapid, automatic compound identification and full-spectrum peak assignment without the need for fitting. LAMAIS correctly identifies over 90 % of components in synthetic mixtures and more than 75 % in experimental mixtures, surpassing other representative methods with a higher F2 score. Our reference library, which currently includes 71 compounds, is tailored to capture the commonality of primary metabolites across diverse plant species. The analysis of real-world samples yielded encouraging results, underscoring LAMAIS's versatility as an auxiliary tool suitable for a variety of botanical sources. For analyst convenience, interactive graphics are utilized as the output format. Significance LAMAIS excels, demonstrating competitiveness and reliability. The approach minimizes repetitive tasks and sample wastage, improving the efficiency of 1D 1H NMR qualitative analysis. Constructing a reference library effectively preserves knowledge, mitigates reliance on human experience, and addresses gaps in the analysis of plant source samples.

MADByTE	NMR			The development of new “omics” platforms is having a significant impact on the landscape of natural products discovery. However, despite the advantages that such platforms bring to the field, there remains no straightforward method for characterizing the chemical landscape of natural products libraries using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D-NMR) experiments. NMR analysis provides a powerful complement to mass spectrometric approaches, given the universal coverage of NMR experiments. However, the high degree of signal overlap, particularly in one-dimensional NMR spectra, has limited applications of this approach. To address this issue, we have developed a new data analysis platform for complex mixture analysis, termed MADByTE (Metabolomics and Dereplication by Two-Dimensional Experiments). This platform employs a combination of TOCSY and HSQC spectra to identify spin system features within complex mixtures and then matches spin system features between samples to create a chemical similarity network for a given sample set. In this report we describe the design and construction of the MADByTE platform and demonstrate the application of chemical similarity networks for both the dereplication of known compound scaffolds and the prioritization of bioactive metabolites from a bacterial prefractionated extract library.

MagMet	NMR			Abstract Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectral analysis of biofluids can be a time‐consuming process, requiring the expertise of a trained operator. With NMR becoming increasingly popular in the field of metabolomics, there is a growing need to change this paradigm and to automate the process. Here we introduce MagMet, an online web server, that automates the processing and quantification of 1D 1H NMR spectra from biofluids—specifically, human serum/plasma metabolites, including those associated with inborn errors of metabolism (IEM). MagMet uses a highly efficient data processing procedure that performs automatic Fourier Transformation, phase correction, baseline optimization, chemical shift referencing, water signal removal, and peak picking/peak alignment. MagMet then uses the peak positions, linewidth information, and J‐couplings from its own specially prepared standard metabolite reference spectral NMR library of 85 serum/plasma compounds to identify and quantify compounds from experimentally acquired NMR spectra of serum/plasma. MagMet employs linewidth adjustment for more consistent quantification of metabolites from higher field instruments and incorporates a highly efficient data processing procedure for more rapid and accurate detection and quantification of metabolites. This optimized algorithm allows the MagMet webserver to quickly detect and quantify 58 serum/plasma metabolites in 2.6 min per spectrum (when processing a dataset of 50–100 spectra). MagMet's performance was also assessed using spectra collected from defined mixtures (simulating other biofluids), with &gt;100 previously measured plasma spectra, and from spiked serum/plasma samples simulating known IEMs. In all cases, MagMet performed with precision and accuracy matching the performance of human spectral profiling experts.

MagMet-F	NMR			Abstract We report the development of a software program, called MagMet‐F, that automates the processing and quantification of 1D 1H NMR of human fecal extracts. To optimize the program, we identified 82 potential fecal metabolites using 1D 1H NMR of six human fecal extracts using manual profiling and a literature review of known fecal metabolites. We acquired pure versions of those metabolites and then acquired their 1D 1H NMR spectra at 700 MHz to generate a fecal metabolite spectral library for MagMet‐F. The fitting of these metabolites by MagMet‐F was iteratively optimized to replicate manual profiling. We validated MagMet‐F's automated profiling using a test set of six fecal extracts. It correctly identified 80% of the compounds and quantified those within &lt;20% of the values determined by manual profiling using Chenomx. We also compared MagMet‐F's profiling performance to two other open‐access NMR profiling tools, Bayesil and Batman. MagMet‐F outperformed both. Bayesil repeatedly overestimated metabolite concentrations by 10% to 40% while Batman was unable to properly quantify any compounds and took 10–20× longer. We have implemented MagMet‐F as a freely accessible web server to enable automated, fast and convenient 1D 1H NMR spectral profiling of fecal samples. MagMet‐F is available at https://www.magmet.ca.

Magnetstein	NMR			In this paper, we present a novel web application for the quantitative analysis of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of mixtures. At its core is the previously published Magnetstein algorithm, which solves the problem of quantification, i.e., determines the relative amounts of components in a mixture. Our innovative approach to this problem, based on the mathematical concept of the Wasserstein distance, makes the algorithm robust to common challenges such as distorted line shapes, spectral overlap, peak shifts, and low resolution. Thus far, Magnetstein has been available solely in an open-source Python package. Now, by creating the web service with a graphical user interface, we make our software available to the broader scientific community. The usage of our web application requires no knowledge of Python or other programming languages and is open and free of charge for academics.

mcfNMR	NMR			In this work, we introduce a novel method for compound identification in mixtures based on nuclear magnetic resonance spectra. Contrary to many other methods, our approach can be used without peak-picking the mixture spectrum and simultaneously optimizes the fit of all individual compound spectra in a given library. At the core of the method, a minimum cost flow problem is solved on a network consisting of nodes that represent spectral peaks of the library compounds and the mixture. We show that our approach can outperform other popular algorithms by applying it to a standard compound identification task for 2D 1H,13C HSQC spectra of artificial mixtures and a natural sample using a library of 501 compounds. Moreover, our method retrieves individual compound concentrations with at least semiquantitative accuracy for artificial mixtures with up to 34 compounds.

MetaboLabPy	NMR			Introduction: NMR spectroscopy is a powerful technique for studying metabolism, either in metabolomics settings or through tracing with stable isotope-enriched metabolic precursors. MetaboLabPy (version 0.9.66) is a free and open-source software package used to process 1D- and 2D-NMR spectra. The software implements a complete workflow for NMR data pre-processing to prepare a series of 1D-NMR spectra for multi-variate statistical data analysis. This includes a choice of algorithms for automated phase correction, segmental alignment, spectral scaling, variance stabilisation, export to various software platforms, and analysis of metabolic tracing data. The software has an integrated help system with tutorials that demonstrate standard workflows and explain the capabilities of MetaboLabPy. Materials and Methods: The software is implemented in Python and uses numerous Python toolboxes, such as numpy, scipy, pandas, etc. The software is implemented in three different packages: metabolabpy, qtmetabolabpy, and metabolabpytools. The metabolabpy package contains classes to handle NMR data and all the numerical routines necessary to process and pre-process 1D NMR data and perform multiplet analysis on 2D-1H, 13C HSQC NMR data. The qtmetabolabpy package contains routines related to the graphical user interface. Results: PySide6 is used to produce a modern and user-friendly graphical user interface. The metabolabpytools package contains routines which are not specific to just handling NMR data, for example, routines to derive isotopomer distributions from the combination of NMR multiplet and GC-MS data. A deep-learning approach for the latter is currently under development. MetaboLabPy is available via the Python Package Index or via GitHub.

MetAssimulo 2.0	NMR		Yes	Motivation Metabolomics extensively utilizes nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy due to its excellent reproducibility and high throughput. Both 1D and 2D NMR spectra provide crucial information for metabolite annotation and quantification, yet present complex overlapping patterns which may require sophisticated machine learning algorithms to decipher. Unfortunately, the limited availability of labeled spectra can hamper application of machine learning, especially deep learning algorithms which require large amounts of labeled data. In this context, simulation of spectral data becomes a tractable solution for algorithm development. Results  Here, we introduce MetAssimulo 2.0, a comprehensive upgrade of the MetAssimulo 1.b metabolomic 1H NMR simulation tool, reimplemented as a Python-based web application. Where MetAssimulo 1.0 only simulated 1D 1H spectra of human urine, MetAssimulo 2.0 expands functionality to urine, blood, and cerebral spinal fluid, enhancing the realism of blood spectra by incorporating a broad protein background. This enhancement enables a closer approximation to real blood spectra, achieving a Pearson correlation of approximately 0.82. Moreover, this tool now includes simulation capabilities for 2D J-resolved (J-Res) and Correlation Spectroscopy spectra, significantly broadening its utility in complex mixture analysis. MetAssimulo 2.0 simulates both single, and groups, of spectra with both discrete (case–control, e.g. heart transplant versus healthy) and continuous (e.g. body mass index) outcomes and includes inter-metabolite correlations. It thus supports a range of experimental designs and demonstrating associations between metabolite profiles and biomedical responses.  By enhancing NMR spectral simulations, MetAssimulo 2.0 is well positioned to support and enhance research at the intersection of deep learning and metabolomics.

MetSCORE	NMR			Background  Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is a cluster of medical conditions and risk factors correlating with insulin resistance that increase the risk of developing cardiometabolic health problems. The specific criteria for diagnosing MetS vary among different medical organizations but are typically based on the evaluation of abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, hyperglycemia, and dyslipidemia. A unique, quantitative and independent estimation of the risk of MetS based only on quantitative biomarkers is highly desirable for the comparison between patients and to study the individual progression of the disease in a quantitative manner. Methods  We used NMR-based metabolomics on a large cohort of donors (n = 21,323; 37.5% female) to investigate the diagnostic value of serum or serum combined with urine to estimate the MetS risk. Specifically, we have determined 41 circulating metabolites and 112 lipoprotein classes and subclasses in serum samples and this information has been integrated with metabolic profiles extracted from urine samples. Results  We have developed MetSCORE, a metabolic model of MetS that combines serum lipoprotein and metabolite information. MetSCORE discriminate patients with MetS (independently identified using the WHO criterium) from general population, with an AUROC of 0.94 (95% CI 0.920–0.952, p < 0.001). MetSCORE is also able to discriminate the intermediate phenotypes, identifying the early risk of MetS in a quantitative way and ranking individuals according to their risk of undergoing MetS (for general population) or according to the severity of the syndrome (for MetS patients). Conclusions  We believe that MetSCORE may be an insightful tool for early intervention and lifestyle modifications, potentially preventing the aggravation of metabolic syndrome.

MixONat	NMR			AbstractThe growing use of herbal medicines worldwide requires ensuring their quality, safety, and efficiency to consumers and patients. Quality controls of vegetal extracts are usually undertaken according to pharmacopeial monographs. Analyses may range from simple chemical experiments to more sophisticated but more accurate methods. Nowadays, metabolomic analyses allow a fast characterization of complex mixtures. In the field, besides mass spectrometry (MS), nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) has gained importance in the direct identification of natural products in complex herbal extracts. For a decade, automated dereplication processes based on 13C-NMR have been emerging to efficiently identify known major compounds in mixtures. Though less sensitive than MS, 13C-NMR has the advantage of being appropriate to discriminate stereoisomers. Since NMR spectrometers nowadays provide useful datasets in a reasonable time frame, we have recently made  available MixONat, a software that processes 13C as well as distortionless enhancement by polarization transfer (DEPT)-135 and -90 data, allowing carbon multiplicity (i.e., CH3, CH2, CH, and C) filtering as a critical step. MixONat requires experimental or predicted chemical shifts (δ   C) databases and displays interactive results that can be refined based on the userʼs phytochemical knowledge. The present article provides step-by-step instructions to use MixONat starting from database creation with freely available and/or marketed δ   C datasets. Then, for training purposes, the reader is led through a 30 – 60 min procedure consisting of the 13C-NMR based dereplication of a peppermint essential oil.	13C NMR Dereplication Using MixONat Software: A Practical Guide to Decipher Natural Products Mixtures[ # ]	https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.1055/a-1470-0446 	Planta Medica	Bruguière, Antoine, Derbré, Séverine, Bréard, Dimitri, Tomi, Félix, Nuzillard, Jean-Marc, & Richomme, Pascal (2021). 13C NMR Dereplication Using MixONat Software: A Practical Guide to Decipher Natural Products Mixtures.

MultiNMRFit	NMR			Motivation  Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is widely used for quantitative analysis of metabolic systems. Accurate extraction of NMR signal parameters—such as chemical shift, intensity, coupling constants, and linewidth—is essential for obtaining information on the structure, concentration, and isotopic composition of metabolites. Results  We present MultiNMRFit, an open-source software designed for high-throughput analysis of 1D NMR spectra, whether acquired individually or as pseudo-2D experiments. MultiNMRFit extracts signal parameters (e.g. intensity, area, chemical shift, and coupling constants) by fitting the experimental spectra using built-in or user-defined signal models that account for multiplicity, providing high flexibility along with robust and reproducible results. The software is accessible both as a Python library and via a graphical user interface, enabling intuitive use by end-users without computational expertise. We demonstrate the robustness and flexibility of MultiNMRFit on 1H, 13C, and 31P NMR datasets collected in metabolomics and isotope labeling studies. Availability and implementation  MultiNMRFit is implemented in Python 3 and was tested on Unix, Windows, and MacOS platforms.

NAPROC-13	NMR			Natural products (NPs) are secondary metabolites of natural origin with broad applications across various human activities, particularly discovering bioactive compounds. Structural elucidation of new NPs entails significant cost and effort. On the other hand, the dereplication of known compounds is crucial for the early exclusion of irrelevant compounds in contemporary pharmaceutical research. NAPROC-13 stands out as a publicly accessible database, providing structural and 13C NMR spectroscopic information for over 25,000 compounds, rendering it a pivotal resource in natural product (NP) research, favoring open science. This study seeks to quantitatively analyze the chemical content, structural diversity, and chemical space coverage of NPs within NAPROC-13, compared to FDA-approved drugs and a very diverse subset of NPs, UNPD-A. Findings indicated that NPs in NAPROC-13 exhibit comparable properties to those in UNPD-A, albeit showcasing a notably diverse array of structural content, scaffolds, ring systems of pharmaceutical interest, and molecular fragments. NAPROC-13 covers a specific region of the chemical multiverse (a generalization of the chemical space from different chemical representations) regarding physicochemical properties and a region as broad as UNPD-A in terms of structural features represented by fingerprints.

nmRanalysis	NMR			Though data acquisition and initial signal preprocessing of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra have achieved high degrees of automation, downstream processing─specifically the profiling of spectra─has bottlenecked the overall NMR analysis workflow. Several efforts have been made to mitigate this bottleneck, but these solutions often trade an increase in automation for limitations elsewhere. In this work, we introduce nmRanalysis, a user-friendly web application that integrates the strengths of existing profiling tools for a more automated profiling workflow. nmRanalysis additionally incorporates novel features, including a machine-learning-driven recommender system for metabolite identification, further increasing the utility of nmRanalysis over the individual tools that it incorporates.	nmRanalysis: An Open-Source Web Application for Semi-automated NMR Metabolite Profiling	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.4c05104	Analytical Chemistry	Flores, J.

NMRFx	NMR			NMR spectroscopy is applied in many scientific disciplines to derive chemical, structural, and dynamical insights into molecular systems. The utility of the technique depends on robust computational protocols for processing, visualizing, and analyzing data acquired using a wide range of experiments. Here we introduce NMRFx, a software application that integrates and augments features of our existing NMRViewJ and NMRFx Processor applications. NMRFx facilitates data processing, peak picking and assignment, chemical shift prediction, molecular structure calculation, and beyond, through a high-speed, feature-rich graphical user interface. This paper describes advances over existing software and presents a series of case studies that demonstrate its utility in diverse contexts. These case studies include the assignments of the protein ubiquitin, a 36 nucleotide RNA construct, and the natural product taccalonolide E, as well as a metabolomics study of triacylglyceride production in algal cells.

NMRhub	NMR			The emergence of reporting standards represents a tremendous stride toward reproducible science, but significant challenges remain. Preserving data provenance is difficult, from generation through processing and analysis to publication. The accuracy of annotations diminish the longer the annotation is separated from the defining event. Manual annotations are often inaccurate or inconsistent. Federation of data across data resources remains challenging. NMRhub was conceived to address these challenges, and to facilitate the application of machine learning (ML) to unlock latent knowledge. NMRhub links the NSF Network for Advanced NMR (NAN), the NMRbox platform, and the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (BMRB) to create an integrated ecosystem that sustains data from the instrument source through public deposition, and facilitates surveys, meta-analyses, and ML. NAN harvests data automatically from connected spectrometers and stores it in a secure archive, parses instrument-provided metadata and transmits data to the user NMRbox account. NMRbox virtualizes and archives the complete software environment used for processing and analysis, provides high performance computation resources including access to Open Science Grid, and tools for assembling BMRB depositions. BMRB, a Core Archive of the World-wide Protein Data Bank (wwPDB), curates, annotates, and provides persistent identifiers for all types of biomolecular NMR data. NMRhub provides single sign on across the constituent platforms, ML-enhanced search of assets across the three platforms, as well as across curated external resources (e.g. PubMed, domain-specific YouTube channels, funding databases), and tools for data transfer among the linked resources. The NMRhub ecosystem spans the complete NMR data lifecycle.

NMRInversions.jl	NMR			This package provides a library of functions as a user-friendly interface for performing time- domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) data processing and visualizations. It is aimed towards NMR users who are not necessarily familiar with the Julia programming language, or even programming in general. Functionality includes importing data from various NMR instrument formats, performing phase-correction on raw data, fitting multi-exponential curves using numerical inversions, and interactively visualizing the results in a straightforward manner. It should be noted that the aforementioned inversions should not be confused with harmonic inversions (Mandelshtam & Taylor, 1997) used in NMR spectroscopy. These can be handled by other packages such as “harminv” (Johnson, 2023), and are not yet implemented in NMRInversions.jl at the time of writing	NMRInversions.jl, a Julia package for time-domain Nuclear Magnetic Resonance	https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.07745.pdf	Journal of Open Source Software	Mavridis, A., & D'Agostino, C.

NMRium	NMR			NMRium is the first web-based software that allows displaying, processing, interpretation, and teaching of 1D and 2D NMR data in a user-friendly interface. It can import the most common data formats (e.g., JCAMP-DX, Bruker, Varian, and Jeol). While the scope for the use of NMRium encompasses a variety of applications such as being a component in data repositories or electronic lab notebooks (ELN), performing structure elucidation or preparing raw spectral data for publication, it also excels in enhancing teaching of NMR interpretation. In this paper, we present some current possibilities of this new tool. Several series of exercises are already provided on https://www.nmrium.org/teaching.

NMRphasing	NMR			Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a highly sensitive analytical technique essential for precise molecular identification and quantification. However, accurate results depend on effective pre-processing to correct for various types of errors. Phase error correction, in particular, is crucial for ensuring the reliability of NMR data. Current methods often rely on a single linear model, which may not adequately address all types of phase errors. As a result, this limitation frequently requires manual intervention, making the process both time-consuming and prone to errors. To address these limitations, we propose three modelling approaches for NMR phase error correction: nonlinear shrinkage, multiple models, and a new optimization function called delta absolute net minimization (DANM). Our comparison of seven methods revealed that nonlinear shrinkage outperformed others in both simulated spectra and a diabetes study, followed by multiple models with DANM. Additionally, our spike-in experiments demonstrated that DANM performed quite well in both single and multiple models. Our nonlinear shrinkage approach is a simple yet effective solution. We provide an open-source R package, NMRphasing, available on CRAN (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/NMRphasing/) and on GitHub (https://github.com/ajiangsfu/NMRphasing).

NP-MRD	NMR			The Natural Products Magnetic Resonance Database (NP-MRD; https://np-mrd.org) is a comprehensive, freely accessible, web-based resource for the deposition, distribution, extraction, and retrieval of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) data on natural products (NPs). The NP-MRD was initially established to support compound de-replication and data dissemination for the NP community. However, that community has now grown to include many users from the metabolomics, microbiomics, foodomics, and nutrition science fields. Indeed, since its launch in 2022, the NP-MRD has expanded enormously in size, scope, and popularity. The current version of NP-MRD now contains nearly 7× more compounds (281 859 versus 40 908) and 7× more NMR spectra (5.5 million versus 817 278) than the first release. More specifically, an additional 4.6 million predicted spectra and another 11 000 spectra simulated from experimental chemical shifts were deposited into the database. Likewise, the number of NMR raw spectral data depositions has grown from 165 spectra per year to >10 000 per year. As a result of this expansion, the number of monthly webpage views has grown from 55 to 20 000 and the number of monthly visitors has increased from 7 to 2500. To address this growth and to better support the expanding needs of its diverse community of users, many additional improvements to the NP-MRD have been made. These include significant enhancements to the data submission process, notable updates to the database’s spectral search utilities and useful additions to support better NMR spectral analysis/prediction. Significant efforts have also been undertaken to remediate and update many of NP-MRD’s database entries. This manuscript describes these database improvements and expansion efforts, along with how they have been implemented and what future upgrades to the NP-MRD are planned.

PRIMA-Panel	NMR			The quality of biological samples used in metabolomics research is significantly influenced by preanalytical factors, such as the timing of centrifugation and freezing. This study aimed to evaluate how preanalytical factors, like delays in centrifugation and freezing, affect metabolomics research. Blood samples, collected in various tube types, were subjected to controlled pre- and postcentrifugation delays. Metabolite levels were quantified using NMR spectroscopy and fitted in linear mixed models used to predict changes in metabolite concentrations over time. The results showed that some metabolites, such as lactic acid, were significantly affected by even short delays, while others remained stable for longer. The study introduced the concept of a “stability time point”, marking when a metabolite’s concentration changes by 20%. These predictive models were validated in a separate cohort. To apply these findings, the authors developed the PRIMA Panel, an open-source R Shiny tool. This tool allows researchers to assess the impact of preanalytical variations on their samples, predict metabolite stability, and generate performance reports. The PRIMA Panel was tested using samples from the Dresden Integrated Liquid Biobank, proving its utility in a real-world biobank setting. The study emphasizes the importance of tracking preanalytical factors to improve the reliability of metabolomics analyses. The PRIMA Panel is available online and for local deployment, providing a practical solution for quality control in metabolomics research. The results of the study underscore the importance of tracking preanalytical factors in biobanking. A versatile tool for assessing their impact on metabolic data is introduced, improving the reliability of future analyses.

PROSPRE	NMR		Yes	NMR is widely considered the gold standard for organic compound structure determination. As such, NMR is routinely used in organic compound identification, drug metabolite characterization, natural product discovery, and the deconvolution of metabolite mixtures in biofluids (metabolomics and exposomics). In many cases, compound identification by NMR is achieved by matching measured NMR spectra to experimentally collected NMR spectral reference libraries. Unfortunately, the number of available experimental NMR reference spectra, especially for metabolomics, medical diagnostics, or drug-related studies, is quite small. This experimental gap could be filled by predicting NMR chemical shifts for known compounds using computational methods such as machine learning (ML). Here, we describe how a deep learning algorithm that is trained on a high-quality, “solvent-aware” experimental dataset can be used to predict 1H chemical shifts more accurately than any other known method. The new program, called PROSPRE (PROton Shift PREdictor) can accurately (mean absolute error of <0.10 ppm) predict 1H chemical shifts in water (at neutral pH), chloroform, dimethyl sulfoxide, and methanol from a user-submitted chemical structure. PROSPRE (pronounced “prosper”) has also been used to predict 1H chemical shifts for >600,000 molecules in many popular metabolomic, drug, and natural product databases.

Protomix	NMR			Background NMR-based metabolomics is a field driven by technological advancements, necessitating the use of advanced preprocessing tools. Despite this need, there is a remarkable scarcity of comprehensive and user-friendly preprocessing tools. To bridge this gap, we have developed Protomix – a Python package designed for metabolomics research. Protomix offers a set of automated, efficient, and user-friendly signal processing steps, tailored to streamline, and enhance the preprocessing phase in metabolomics studies. Results  This package presents a comprehensive preprocessing pipeline compatible with various data analysis tools. It encompasses a suite of functionalities for data extraction, preprocessing, and interactive visualization. Additionally, it includes a tutorial in the form of a Python Jupyter notebook, specifically designed for the analysis of 1D 1H-NMR metabolomics data related to prostate cancer and benign prostatic hyperplasia. Conclusions  Protomix simplifies the preprocessing phase and incorporates interactive data visualization, making it accessible to researchers of varying programming skills. Ongoing development and optimization will continue to solidify its contribution to the metabolomics field.

PyINETA	NMR			Robust annotation of compounds is a critical element in metabolomics. The 13C-detection NMR experiment incredible natural abundance double-quantum transfer experiment (INADEQUATE) stands out as a powerful tool for structural elucidation, but this valuable experiment is not often included in metabolomics studies. This is partly due to the lack of a community platform that provides structural information based on INADEQUATE. Also, it is often the case that a single study uses various NMR experiments synergistically to improve the quality of information or balance total NMR experiment time, but there is no public platform that can integrate the outputs of INADEQUATE with other NMR experiments. Here, we introduce PyINETA, a Python-based INADEQUATE network analysis. PyINETA is an open-source platform that provides structural information on molecules using INADEQUATE, conducts database searches using an INADEQUATE library, and integrates information on INADEQUATE and a complementary NMR experiment 13C J-resolved experiment (13C-JRES). 13C-JRES was chosen because of its ability to efficiently provide relative quantification in a study of the 13C-enriched samples. Those steps are carried out automatically, and PyINETA keeps track of all the pipeline parameters and outputs, ensuring the transparency of annotation in metabolomics. Our evaluation of PyINETA using a model mouse study showed that PyINETA successfully integrated INADEQUATE and 13C-JRES. The results showed that 13C-labeled amino acids that were fed to mice were transferred to different tissues and were transformed to other metabolites. The distribution of those compounds was tissue-specific, showing enrichment of specific metabolites in the liver, spleen, pancreas, muscle, or lung. PyINETA is freely available on NMRbox.

ROIAL-NMR	NMR			An organism's metabolic profile provides vital information pertaining to its physiology or pathology. To monitor these biochemical changes, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy has found success in non-invasively observing metabolite changes within intact samples in an untargeted manner. However, biological samples are chemically complex, comprised of many different constituents (amino acids, carbohydrates, and lipids) at varying concentrations depending on physiological and pathological conditions. Due to the narrow spectral window of proton NMR, compound resonance frequencies can often overlap, making the identification and monitoring of metabolites difficult and time consuming, particularly when dealing with large numbers of samples. Here, we introduce a Python program (ROIAL-NMR) to systematically identify potential metabolites from defined proton NMR spectral regions-of-interest (ROIs), which are identified from complex biological samples (i.e., human serum, saliva, sweat, urine, CSF, and tissues) using the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) as a reference platform. Briefly, for disease-versus-control studies, the program considers disease types and utilizes study-defined ROIs together with their differing intensity levels, according to sample types, in differentiating disease from control to propose potential metabolites represented by these ROIs in an output table. In this report, we illustrate the utility of the program with one of our recent studies, where we measured proton NMR spectra of serum samples taken from lung cancer (LC) patients, with and without Alzheimer's disease and related dementia (ADRD). The program successfully identified 88 metabolites, with 66 differentiating LC from control patients, and 80 distinguishing LC patients with ADRD from those without ADRD to provide important information regarding pathophysiology in complex biological samples.

SAND	NMR			Developments in untargeted nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) metabolomics enable the profiling of thousands of biological samples. The exploitation of this rich source of information requires a detailed quantification of spectral features. However, the development of a consistent and automatic workflow has been challenging because of extensive signal overlap. To address this challenge, we introduce the software Spectral Automated NMR Decomposition (SAND). SAND follows on from the previous success of time-domain modeling and automatically quantifies entire spectra without manual interaction. The SAND approach uses hybrid optimization with Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, employing subsampling in both time and frequency domains. In particular, SAND randomly divides the time-domain data into training and validation sets to help avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the accuracy of SAND, which provides a correlation of ∼0.9 with ground truth on cases including highly overlapped simulated data sets, a two-compound mixture, and a urine sample spiked with different amounts of a four-compound mixture. We further demonstrate an automated annotation using correlation networks derived from SAND decomposed peaks, and on average, 74% of peaks for each compound can be recovered in single clusters. SAND is available in NMRbox, the cloud computing environment for NMR software hosted by the Network for Advanced NMR (NAN). Since the SAND method uses time-domain subsampling (i.e., random subset of time-domain points), it has the potential to be extended to a higher dimensionality and nonuniformly sampled data.

SMolESY	NMR			Small Molecule Enhancement SpectroscopY (SMolESY) was employed to develop a unique and fully automated computational solution for the assignment and integration of 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) signals from metabolites in challenging matrices containing macromolecules (herein blood products). Sensitive and reliable quantitation is provided by instant signal deconvolution and straightforward integration bolstered by spectral resolution enhancement and macromolecular signal suppression. The approach is highly efficient, requiring only standard one-dimensional 1H NMR spectra and avoiding the need for sample preprocessing, complex deconvolution, and spectral baseline fitting. The performance of the algorithm, developed using >4000 NMR serum and plasma spectra, was evaluated using an additional >8800 spectra, yielding an assignment accuracy greater than 99.5% for all 22 metabolites targeted. Further validation of its quantitation capabilities illustrated a reliable performance among challenging phenotypes. The simplicity and complete automation of the approach support the application of NMR-based metabolite panel measurements in clinical and population screening applications.

ukbnmr	NMR			Metabolic biomarker data quantified by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy in approximately 121,000 UK Biobank participants has recently been released as a community resource, comprising absolute concentrations and ratios of 249 circulating metabolites, lipids, and lipoprotein sub-fractions. Here we identify and characterise additional sources of unwanted technical variation influencing individual biomarkers in the data available to download from UK Biobank. These included sample preparation time, shipping plate well, spectrometer batch effects, drift over time within spectrometer, and outlier shipping plates. We developed a procedure for removing this unwanted technical variation, and demonstrate that it increases signal for genetic and epidemiological studies of the NMR metabolic biomarker data in UK Biobank. We subsequently developed an R package, ukbnmr, which we make available to the wider research community to enhance the utility of the UK Biobank NMR metabolic biomarker data and to facilitate rapid analysis.

FlavorFormer	NMR		Yes	Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is a promising method for analyzing mixtures, but identifying components in mixtures using NMR spectra remains challenging. Here, FlavorFormer is proposed by incorporating a hybrid CNN and Transformer architecture to capture both local features and global dependencies from 1H NMR spectra. Furthermore, it leverages a combination of the Bi-encoder and Cross-encoder, a fusion pooling strategy, and a weighted loss function to identify compounds correctly. After training on augmented datasets, FlavorFormer was tested on an augmented test set and two experimental datasets. The model achieved consistently high performance metrics on the test set (ACC 98.84 ± 0.86 %, TPR 99.90 ± 0.10 %, FPR 2.24 ± 1.77 %), a known flavor mixture dataset (ACC 95.44 ± 0.00 %, TPR 95.19 ± 1.24 %, FPR 4.31 ± 0.33 %), and an unknown flavor mixture dataset (ACC 94.44 ± 2.41 %, TPR 93.33 ± 11.55 %, FPR 5.26 ± 0.00 %). FlavorFormer outperforms the state-of-the-art pSCNN approach in analyzing complex flavor mixtures, displaying greater robustness and substantially higher TPR. These findings highlight the capability of FlavorFormer to identify compounds in flavor mixtures accurately. Altogether, FlavorFormer enables the accurate identification of compounds in flavor mixtures, establishing it as a powerful tool for NMR-based mixture studies.

NMR2Struct	NMR		Yes	Rapid determination of molecular structures can greatly accelerate workflows across many chemical disciplines. However, elucidating structure using only one-dimensional (1D) NMR spectra, the most readily accessible data, remains an extremely challenging problem because of the combinatorial explosion of the number of possible molecules as the number of constituent atoms is increased. Here, we introduce a multitask machine learning framework that predicts the molecular structure (formula and connectivity) of an unknown compound solely based on its 1D 1H and/or 13C NMR spectra. First, we show how a transformer architecture can be constructed to efficiently solve the task, traditionally performed by chemists, of assembling large numbers of molecular fragments into molecular structures. Integrating this capability with a convolutional neural network, we build an end-to-end model for predicting structure from spectra that is fast and accurate. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this framework on molecules with up to 19 heavy (non-hydrogen) atoms, a size for which there are trillions of possible structures. Without relying on any prior chemical knowledge such as the molecular formula, we show that our approach predicts the exact molecule 69.6% of the time within the first 15 predictions, reducing the search space by up to 11 orders of magnitude.

NMRformer	NMR		Yes	Metabolite identification from 1D 1H NMR spectra is a major challenge in NMR-based metabolomics. This study introduces NMRformer, a Transformer-based deep learning framework for accurate peak assignment and metabolite identification in 1D 1H NMR spectroscopy. Unlike traditional approaches, NMRformer interprets spectra as sequences of spectral peaks and integrates a self-attention mechanism and peak height ratios directly into the Transformer encoder layer. It has the capability to recognize and interpret long-range dependencies between peaks and to quickly identify peaks corresponding to identical metabolites. The effectiveness of NMRformer has been rigorously validated by analyzing real 1D 1H NMR spectra from a variety of cellular and biofluid samples. NMRformer achieved peak assignment accuracies above 88% and metabolite identification accuracies above 80% in four types of cellular samples. It also achieved peak assignment accuracies above 88% and metabolite identification accuracies above 80% in three types of biofluid samples. These results underscore the ability of NMRformer to significantly improve the accuracy and efficiency of peak assignment and metabolite identification in NMR-based metabolomics studies.

NMRQNet	NMR		Yes	Nuclear Magnetic Resonance is a powerful platform that reveals the metabolomics profiles within biofluids or tissues and contributes to personalized treatments in medical practice. However, data volume and complexity hinder the exploration of NMR spectra. Besides, the lack of fast and accurate computational tools that can handle the automatic identification and quantification of essential metabolites from NMR spectra also slows the wide application of these techniques in clinical. We present NMRQNet, a deep-learning-based pipeline for automatic identification and quantification of dominant metabolite candidates within human plasma samples. The estimated relative concentrations could be further applied in statistical analysis to extract the potential biomarkers. We evaluate our method on multiple plasma samples, including species from mice to humans, curated using three anticoagulants, covering healthy and patient conditions in neurological disorder disease, greatly expanding the metabolomics analytical space in plasma. NMRQNet accurately reconstructed the original spectra and obtained significantly better quantification results than the earlier computational methods. Besides, NMRQNet also proposed relevant metabolites biomarkers that could potentially explain the risk factors associated with the condition. NMRQNet, with improved prediction performance, highlights the limitations in the existing approaches and has shown strong application potential for future metabolomics disease studies using plasma samples.

pSCNN	NMR		Yes	Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is highly unbiased and reproducible, which provides us a powerful tool to analyze mixtures consisting of small molecules. However, the compound identification in NMR spectra of mixtures is highly challenging because of chemical shift variations of the same compound in different mixtures and peak overlapping among molecules. Here, we present a pseudo-Siamese convolutional neural network method (pSCNN) to identify compounds in mixtures for NMR spectroscopy. A data augmentation method was implemented for the superposition of several NMR spectra sampled from a spectral database with random noises. The augmented dataset was split and used to train, validate and test the pSCNN model. Two experimental NMR datasets (flavor mixtures and additional flavor mixture) were acquired to benchmark its performance in real applications. The results show that the proposed method can achieve good performances in the augmented test set (ACC = 99.80%, TPR = 99.70% and FPR = 0.10%), the flavor mixtures dataset (ACC = 97.62%, TPR = 96.44% and FPR = 2.29%) and the additional flavor mixture dataset (ACC = 91.67%, TPR = 100.00% and FPR = 10.53%). We have demonstrated that the translational invariance of convolutional neural networks can solve the chemical shift variation problem in NMR spectra. In summary, pSCNN is an off-the-shelf method to identify compounds in mixtures for NMR spectroscopy because of its accuracy in compound identification and robustness to chemical shift variation.

NMR molecular networking	NMR/Networks			Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) is among the most widely used techniques for structure determination, yet automated workflows remain underdeveloped compared to mass spectrometry. In this work, we introduce NMR molecular networking and apply it to Heteronuclear Single Quantum Coherence (HSQC) spectra, a key 2D-NMR experiment for structure elucidation. We adapt core principles of MS² networking—transitivity across multiple spectra, dereplication, and annotation propagation—to NMR-driven workflows. First, we develop a modified Hungarian distance metric for HSQC peak matching. Benchmarks show that using this metric, traditional spectral lookup with this score recovers ~70-80% of available structural similarity, but efficiency does not improve when increasing the size of the spectral library. Second, we establish NMR molecular networking using HSQC spectra to propagate annotations and dereplicate compounds. Case studies of experimental natural product spectra demonstrate that annotation transitivity within networks accelerates and improves identification of unknowns. Third, we introduce algorithmic molecular networking, which integrates graph topology metrics to correct inefficient rankings and reduce false positives. Together, these approaches define the first generalizable framework for NMR molecular networking, enabling scalable, high-throughput annotation for natural product discovery and drug development.

Aspergillus Metabolome Database	Organism specific			The Aspergillus Metabolome Database is a free online resource to perform metabolite annotation in mass spectrometry studies devoted to the genus Aspergillus. The database was created by retrieving and curating information on 2811 compounds present in 601 different species and subspecies of the genus Aspergillus. A total of 1514 scientific journals where these metabolites are mentioned were added as meta-information linked to their respective compounds in the database. A web service to query the database based on m/z (mass/charge ratio) searches was added to CEU Mass Mediator; these queries can be performed over the Aspergillus database only, or they can also include a user-selectable set of other general metabolomic databases. This functionality is offered via web applications and via RESTful services. Furthermore, the complete content of the database has been made available in .csv files and as a MySQL database to facilitate its integration into third-party tools. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first database and the first service specifically devoted to Aspergillus metabolite annotation based on m/z searches.

FoodAtlas	Organism specific			Automated generation of knowledge graphs that accurately capture published information can help with knowledge organization and access, which have the potential to accelerate discovery and innovation. Here, we present an integrated pipeline to construct a large-scale knowledge graph using large language models in an active learning setting. We apply our pipeline to the association of raw food, ingredients, and chemicals, a domain that lacks such knowledge resources. By using an iterative active learning approach of 4120 manually curated premise-hypothesis pairs as training data for ten consecutive cycles, the entailment model extracted 230,848 food-chemical composition relationships from 155,260 scientific papers, with 106,082 (46.0 %) of them never been reported in any published database. To augment the knowledge incorporated in the knowledge graph, we further incorporated information from 5 external databases and ontology sources. We then applied a link prediction model to identify putative food-chemical relationships that were not part of the constructed knowledge graph. Validation of the 443 hypotheses generated by the link prediction model resulted in 355 new food-chemical relationships, while results show that the model score correlates well (R2 = 0.70) with the probability of a novel finding. This work demonstrates how automated learning from literature at scale can accelerate discovery and support practical applications through reproducible, evidence-based capture of latent interactions of diverse entities, such as food and chemicals.

gutMGene v2.0	Organism specific			Abstract   The gut microbiota is essential for various physiological functions in the host, primarily through the metabolites it produces. To support researchers in uncovering how gut microbiota contributes to host homeostasis, we launched the gutMGene database in 2022. In this updated version, we conducted an extensive review of previous papers and incorporated new papers to extract associations among gut microbes, their metabolites, and host genes, carefully classifying these as causal or correlational. Additionally, we performed metabolic reconstructions for representative gut microbial genomes from both human and mouse. gutMGene v2.0 features an upgraded web interface, providing users with improved accessibility and functionality. This upgraded version is freely available at http://bio-computing.hrbmu.edu.cn/gutmgene.

gutSMASH	Organism specific			The gut microbiota produce hundreds of small molecules, many of which modulate host physiology. Although efforts have been made to identify biosynthetic genes for secondary metabolites, the chemical output of the gut microbiome consists predominantly of primary metabolites. Here, we systematically profile primary metabolic genes from the gut microbiome, identifying 19,885 gene clusters in 4,240 high-quality microbial genomes. We find marked differences in pathway distribution among phyla, reflecting distinct strategies for energy capture. These data explain taxonomic differences in short-chain fatty acid production and suggest a characteristic metabolic niche for each taxon. Analysis of 1,135 subjects from a Dutch population-based cohort shows that the level of 14 microbiome-derived metabolites in plasma is almost completely uncorrelated with the metagenomic abundance of the corresponding biosynthetic genes, revealing a crucial role for pathway-specific gene regulation and metabolite flux. This work is a starting point for understanding differences in how bacterial taxa contribute to the chemistry of the microbiome.

HORDB 	Organism specific			Peptide hormones (also known as hormone peptides and polypeptide hormones) are hormones composed of peptides and are signal transduction molecules produced by a class of multicellular organisms. It plays an important role in the physiological and behavioral regulation of animals and humans as well as in the growth of plants. In order to promote the research on peptide hormones, we constructed HORDB database. The database currently has a total of 6024 entries, including 5729 peptide hormones, 40 peptide drugs and 255 marketed pharmaceutical preparations information. Each entry provided comprehensive information related to the peptide, including general information, sequence, activity, structure, physical information and literature information.

IDBac	Organism specific			Libraries of microorganisms have served as a cornerstone of therapeutic drug discovery, though the continued re-isolation of known natural product chemical entities has remained a significant obstacle to discovery efforts. A major contributing factor to this redundancy is the duplication of bacterial taxa in a library, which can be mitigated through the use of a variety of DNA sequencing strategies and/or mass spectrometry-informed bioinformatics platforms so that the library is created with minimal phylogenetic, and thus minimal natural product overlap. IDBac is a MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry-based bioinformatics platform used to assess overlap within collections of environmental bacterial isolates. It allows environmental isolate redundancy to be reduced while considering both phylogeny and natural product production. However, manually selecting isolates for addition to a library during this process was time intensive and left to the researcher’s discretion. Here, we developed an algorithm that automates the prioritization of hundreds to thousands of environmental microorganisms in IDBac. The algorithm performs iterative reduction of natural product mass feature overlap within groups of isolates that share high homology of protein mass features. Employing this automation serves to minimize human bias and greatly increase efficiency in the microbial strain prioritization process.

LiqBioer	Organism specific			Cancer biomarkers are measurable indicators that play vital roles in clinical applications. Biomarkers in body fluids have gained considerable attention since the development of liquid biopsy, and their data volume is rapidly increasing. Nevertheless, current research lacks the compilation of published cancer body fluid biomarkers into a centralized and sustainable repository for researchers and clinicians, despite a handful of small-scale and specific data resources. To fulfill this purpose, we developed liquid biomarker (LiqBioer) containing 6231 manually curated records from 3447 studies, covering 3056 biomarkers and 74 types of cancer in 22 tissues. LiqBioer allows users to browse and download comprehensive information on body liquid biomarkers, including cancer types, source studies and clinical usage. As a comprehensive resource for body fluid biomarkers of cancer, LiqBioer is a powerful tool for researchers and clinicians to query and retrieve biomarkers in liquid biopsy.

MDSi	Organism specific			Abstract   Background   Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) harbors the small diploid genome (~ 450 Mb) and shows the high inbreeding rate and close relationship to several major foods, feed, fuel and bioenergy grasses. Previously, we created a mini foxtail millet, xiaomi, with an Arabidopsis-like life cycle. The de novo assembled genome data with high-quality and an efficient Agrobacterium-mediated genetic transformation system made xiaomi an ideal C4 model system. The mini foxtail millet has been widely shared in the research community and as a result there is a growing need for a user-friendly portal and intuitive interface to perform exploratory analysis of the data.      Results   Here, we built a Multi-omics Database for Setaria italica (MDSi, http://sky.sxau.edu.cn/MDSi.htm), that contains xiaomi genome of 161,844 annotations, 34,436 protein-coding genes and their expression information in 29 different tissues of xiaomi (6) and JG21 (23) samples that can be showed as an Electronic Fluorescent Pictograph (xEFP) in-situ. Moreover, the whole-genome resequencing (WGS) data of 398 germplasms, including 360 foxtail millets and 38 green foxtails and the corresponding metabolic data were available in MDSi. The SNPs and Indels of these germplasms were called in advance and can be searched and compared in an interactive manner. Common tools including BLAST, GBrowse, JBrowse, map viewer, and data downloads were implemented in MDSi.      Conclusion   The MDSi constructed in this study integrated and visualized data from three levels of genomics, transcriptomics and metabolomics, and also provides information on the variation of hundreds of germplasm resources that can satisfies the mainstream requirements and supports the corresponding research community.

MetaboSeek	Organism specific			Untargeted metabolomics via high-resolution mass spectrometry can reveal more than 100,000 molecular features in a single sample, many of which may represent unidentified metabolites, posing significant challenges to data analysis. We here introduce Metaboseek, an open-source analysis platform designed for untargeted comparative metabolomics and demonstrate its utility by uncovering biosynthetic functions of a conserved fat metabolism pathway, α-oxidation, using C. elegans as a model. Metaboseek integrates modules for molecular feature detection, statistics, molecular formula prediction, and fragmentation analysis, which uncovers more than 200 previously uncharacterized α-oxidation-dependent metabolites in an untargeted comparison of wildtype and α-oxidation-defective hacl-1 mutants. The identified metabolites support the predicted enzymatic function of HACL-1 and reveal that α-oxidation participates in metabolism of endogenous β-methyl-branched fatty acids and food-derived cyclopropane lipids. Our results showcase compound discovery and feature annotation at scale via untargeted comparative metabolomics applied to a conserved primary metabolic pathway and suggest a model for the metabolism of cyclopropane lipids. Untargeted mass spectrometry-based metabolomics can reveal new biochemistry, but data analysis is challenging. Here, the authors develop Metaboseek, an open-source software that facilitates metabolite discovery, and apply it to characterize fatty acid alpha-oxidation in C. elegans.

MiMIR	Organism specific			Motivation 1H-NMR metabolomics is rapidly becoming a standard resource in large epidemiological studies to acquire metabolic profiles in large numbers of samples in a relatively low-priced and standardized manner. Concomitantly, metabolomics-based models are increasingly developed that capture disease risk or clinical risk factors. These developments raise the need for user-friendly toolbox to inspect new 1H-NMR metabolomics data and project a wide array of previously established risk models. Results  We present MiMIR (Metabolomics-based Models for Imputing Risk), a graphical user interface that provides an intuitive framework for ad hoc statistical analysis of Nightingale Health’s 1H-NMR metabolomics data and allows for the projection and calibration of 24 pre-trained metabolomics-based models, without any pre-required programming knowledge.

mVOC 4.0	Organism specific			Metabolomic microbiome research has become an important topic for understanding agricultural, ecological as well as health correlations. Only the determination of both the non-volatile and the volatile organic compound (mVOC) production by microorganisms allows a holistic view for understanding the complete potential of metabolomes and metabolic capabilities of bacteria. In the recent past, more and more bacterial headspaces and culture media were analyzed, leading to an accumulation of about 3500 mVOCs in the updated mVOC 4.0 database, including compounds synthesized by the newly discovered non-canonical terpene pathway. Approximately 10% of all mVOCs can be assigned with a biological function, some mVOCs have the potential to impact agriculture in the future (e.g. eco-friendly pesticides) or animal and human health care. mVOC 4.0 offers various options for exploring extensively annotated mVOC data from different perspectives, including improved mass spectrometry matching.

MyxoDB	Organism specific			Myxobacteria are fascinating prokaryotes featuring a potent capacity for producing a wealth of bioactive molecules with intricate chemical topology as well as intriguing enzymology, and thus it is critical to developing an efficient pipeline for bioprospecting. Herein, we construct the database MyxoDB, the first public compendium solely dedicated to myxobacteria, which enabled us to provide an overview of the structural diversity and taxonomic distribution of known myxobacterial natural products. Moreover, we demonstrated that the cutting-edge NMR-based metabolomics was effective to differentiate the biosynthetic priority of myxobacteria, whereby MyxoDB could greatly streamline the dereplication of multifarious known compounds and accordingly speed up the discovery of new compounds. This led to the rapid identification of a class of linear di-lipopeptides (archangimins) and a rare rearranged sterol (corasterol) that were endowed with unique chemical architectures and/or biosynthetic enzymology. We also showcased that NMR-based metabolomics, MyxoDB, and genomics can also work concertedly to accelerate the targeted discovery of a polyketidic compound pyxipyrrolone C. All in all, this study sets the stage for the discovery of many more novel natural products from underexplored myxobacterial resources.

Omics Untargeted Key Script	Organism specific			Large-scale untargeted LC-MS-based metabolomic profiling is a valuable source for systems biology and biomarker discovery. Data analysis and processing are major tasks due to the high complexity of generated signals and the presence of unwanted variations. In the present study, we introduce an R-based open-source collection of scripts called OUKS (Omics Untargeted Key Script), which provides comprehensive data processing. OUKS is developed by integrating various R packages and metabolomics software tools and can be easily set up and prepared to create a custom pipeline. Novel computational features are related to quality control samples-based signal processing and are implemented by gradient boosting, tree-based, and other nonlinear regression algorithms. Bladder cancer biomarkers discovery study which is based on untargeted LC-MS profiling of urine samples is performed to demonstrate exhaustive functionality of the developed software tool. Unique examination among dozens of metabolomics-specific data curation methods was carried out at each processing step. As a result, potential biomarkers were identified, statistically validated, and described by metabolism disorders. Our study demonstrates that OUKS helps to make untargeted LC-MS metabolomic profiling with the latest computational features readily accessible in a ready-to-use unified manner to a research community.

OrchidMD	Organism specific			The Orchidaceae family, with its unparalleled species diversity among angiosperms, is integral to ornamental, medicinal, cultural, and ecological value. Multi-omics techniques have proven invaluable for the identification of candidate genes and the advancement of functional genomics research. Nevertheless, the application of these technologies in Orchidaceae remains severely limited due to the lack of effective platforms that can integrate and analyze multi-omics data, especially in understanding the mechanisms underlying key traits such as distinctive floral morphology. In this study, we present OrchidMD, the Orchid Multi-omics Database (www.orchidcomics.com), a resource platform that integrates data from five omics layers: genomics, transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics, and phenomics, encompassing a total of 213 species. OrchidMD is equipped with 18 specialized statistical and analytical tools, and features a user-friendly interface that facilitates efficient gene mining, multi-omics data exploration, and integrative interactive analysis. A case study on the comprehensive identification of the pan-ARF gene family across Orchidaceae species demonstrates the effectiveness and convenience of OrchidMD. Furthermore, experimental validation further shows that transgenic overexpression of CsiARF04 promotes the differentiation and budding of orchid rhizomes. In addition, another case study using gene editing in orchids, CRISPR Design was employed to predict the CsiPDS target site in Cymbidium sinense. Effective editing was subsequently achieved via Agrobacterium-mediated delivery of the CRISPR/Cas9 vector into leaves. These results underscore OrchidMD‘s formidable capacity to discern candidate genes associated with salient traits and elucidate their regulatory mechanisms. Thus, OrchidMD serves as a pivotal platform advancing multi-dimensional biological research and functional genomics in orchids.

PaIRKAT	Organism specific			High-throughput data such as metabolomics, genomics, transcriptomics, and proteomics have become familiar data types within the "-omics" family. For this work, we focus on subsets that interact with one another and represent these "pathways" as graphs. Observed pathways often have disjoint components, i.e. nodes or sets of nodes (metabolites, etc.) not connected to any other within the pathway which notably lessens testing power. In this paper we propose the Pathway Integrated Regression-based Kernel Association Test (PaIRKAT), a new kernel machine regression method for incorporating known pathway information into the semi-parametric kernel regression framework. This paper also contributes an application of a graph kernel regularization method for overcoming disconnected pathways. By incorporating a regularized or "smoothed" graph into a score test, PaIRKAT is capable of providing more powerful tests for associations between biological pathways and phenotypes of interest and will be helpful in identifying novel pathways for targeted clinical research. We evaluate this method through several simulation studies and an application to real metabolomics data from the COPDGene study. Our simulation studies illustrate the robustness of this method to incorrect and incomplete pathway knowledge, and the real data analysis shows meaningful improvements of testing power in pathways. PaIRKAT was developed for application to metabolomic pathway data, but the techniques are easily generalizable to other data sources with a graph-like structure.    Author SummaryPaIRKAT is a tool for improving testing power on high dimensional data by including graph topography in the kernel machine regression setting. Studies on high dimensional data can struggle to include the complex relationships between variables. The semi-parametric kernel machine regression model is a powerful tool for capturing these types of relationships. They provide a framework for testing for relationships between outcomes of interest and high dimensional data such as metabolomic, genomic, or proteomic pathways. Our paper proposes PaIRKAT, a method for including known biological connections between high dimensional variables by representing them as edges of graphs or networks. It is common for nodes (e.g. metabolites) to be disconnected from all others within the graph, which leads to meaningful decreases in testing power whether or not the graph information is included. We include a graph regularization or smoothing approach for managing this issue. We demonstrate the benefits of this approach through simulation studies and an application to the metabolomic data from the COPDGene study.

PeanutOmics	Organism specific			Peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an economically important legume crops, yet a comprehensive understanding of its gene expression dynamics across developmental stages remains limited. To address this, we constructed a multi-omics atlas spanning transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic profiles across 22 primary vegetative and reproductive tissues. We identified 53,030 expressed genes at the transcript level, 12,826 with protein evidence, and 2,035 metabolites. Among these, 2,147 genes encoded novel proteins and 274 produced microproteins. Functional analysis identified WDR13, TANGO, RPP13, DEF3, SLR1-BP, and SLE2 as key genes with roles in development and stress response. Co-expression analysis grouped genes into 24 modules, many showing tissue-specific expression. Pathway enrichment and correlation network analysis highlighted the critical roles of IAA and ARF gene families in hormone signaling and cell growth, particularly in peg development. To support data accessibility and downstream research, we developed PeanutOmics (https://cgm.sjtu.edu.cn/PeanutOmics), a user-friendly platform integrating multi-omics datasets with advanced analytical tools. This atlas offers a valuable resource for understanding gene and metabolite regulation in peanut and lays the groundwork for advanced molecular breeding and improved crop productivity.

SmilODB	Organism specific			Introduction Salvia miltiorrhiza Bunge (Danshen) is a traditional medicinal plant widely used in the treatment of cardiovascular and inflammatory diseases. Although various omics resources have been published, there remains a lack of an integrated platform to unify genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic, and metabolomic data.MethodsTo address this gap, we constructed the S. miltiorrhiza Multi-omics Database (SmilODB, http://www.isage.top:56789/), which systematically integrates publicly available genome assemblies, transcriptome datasets, metabolic pathway annotations, and protein structural predictions. Protein structures were predicted using the RoseTTAFold algorithm, and all data were visualized using interactive heat maps, line charts, and histograms.ResultsSmilODB includes: (i) two genome assemblies of S. miltiorrhiza, (ii) 48 tissue-specific transcriptome datasets from root, leaf, and other vegetative tissues, (iii) annotated biosynthetic pathways for bioactive compounds such as tanshinones and salvianolic acids, and (iv) 2,967 high-confidence protein models. The database also integrates bioinformatics tools such as genome browsers, BLAST, and gene heatmap generators.DiscussionSmilODB provides an accessible and comprehensive platform to explore multi-omics data related to S. miltiorrhiza.

StreptomeDB 4.0	Organism specific			Streptomycetes remain an important bacterial source of natural products (NPs) with significant therapeutic promise, particularly in the fight against antimicrobial resistance. Herein, we present StreptomeDB 4.0, a substantial update of the database that includes expanded content and several new features. Currently, StreptomeDB 4.0 contains over 8500 NPs originating from ∼3900 streptomycetes, manually annotated from ∼7600 PubMed-indexed peer-reviewed articles. The database was enhanced by two in-house developments: (i) automated literature-mined NP–protein relationships (hyperlinked to the CPRiL web server) and (ii) pharmacophore-based NP–protein interactions (predicted with the ePharmaLib dataset). Moreover, genome mining was supplemented through hyperlinks to the widely used antiSMASH database. To facilitate NP structural dereplication, interactive visualization tools were implemented, namely the JSpecView applet and plotly.js charting library for predicted nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrometry spectral data, respectively. Furthermore, both the backend database and the frontend web interface were redesigned, and several software packages, including PostgreSQL and Django, were updated to the latest versions.

The Molecular Human	Organism specific			In-depth multiomic phenotyping provides molecular insights into complex physiological processes and their pathologies. Here, we report on integrating 18 diverse deep molecular phenotyping (omics-) technologies applied to urine, blood, and saliva samples from 391 participants of the multiethnic diabetes Qatar Metabolomics Study of Diabetes (QMDiab). Using 6,304 quantitative molecular traits with 1,221,345 genetic variants, methylation at 470,837 DNA CpG sites, and gene expression of 57,000 transcripts, we determine (1) within-platform partial correlations, (2) between-platform mutual best correlations, and (3) genome-, epigenome-, transcriptome-, and phenome-wide associations. Combined into a molecular network of &gt; 34,000 statistically significant trait-trait links in biofluids, our study portrays “The Molecular Human”. We describe the variances explained by each omics in the phenotypes (age, sex, BMI, and diabetes state), platform complementarity, and the inherent correlation structures of multiomics data. Further, we construct multi-molecular network of diabetes subtypes. Finally, we generated an open-access web interface to “The Molecular Human” ( http://comics.metabolomix.com ), providing interactive data exploration and hypotheses generation possibilities. Multiomic phenotyping provides molecular insights into complex physiological processes and pathologies. The study uses 18 omics platforms to analyze biofluids from 391 participants. It constructs a comprehensive molecular network based on omics integration, revealing insights into diabetes and other traits.

MetaboLM	Specialized		Yes	Early prediction of chronic diseases from routine blood tests has potential to transform public health prevention strategies. Here, we developed MetaboLM, a transformer-based language model pre-trained on plasma metabolomics data from 83,744 relatively healthy UK Biobank participants. After fine-tuning with metabolomics data from individuals diagnosed with 16 common chronic diseases, MetaboLM demonstrated excellent performance in disease prediction and stratification, and generated a metabolomic risk score (MetaboRS) capable of predicting disease onset more than 10 years in advance. MetaboRS outperformed established demographic predictors in 16 diseases, and outperformed atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk equations in 13 diseases. Furthermore, interpretability analysis of the attention mechanism identified key metabolites related to disease prediction. These findings underscore the potential of metabolomic language models and derived risk scores for predicting the risk of multiple diseases and for other potential downstream applications.

MolSpectLLM	Specialized		Yes	Recent advances in molecular foundation models have shown impressive performance in molecular property prediction and de novo molecular design, with promising applications in areas such as drug discovery and reaction prediction. Nevertheless, most existing approaches rely exclusively on SMILES representations and overlook both experimental spectra and 3D structural information—two indispensable sources for capturing molecular behavior in real-world scenarios. This limitation reduces their effectiveness in tasks where stereochemistry, spatial conformation, and experimental validation are critical. To overcome these challenges, we propose MolSpectLLM, a molecular foundation model pretrained on Qwen2.5-7B that unifies experimental spectroscopy with molecular 3D structure. By explicitly modeling molecular spectra, MolSpectLLM achieves state-of-the-art performance on spectrum-related tasks, with an average accuracy of 0.53 across NMR, IR, and MS benchmarks. MolSpectLLM also shows strong performance on the spectra analysis task, obtaining 15.5% sequence accuracy and 41.7% token accuracy on Spectra-to-SMILES, substantially outperforming large general-purpose LLMs. More importantly, MolSpectLLM not only achieves strong performance on molecular elucidation tasks, but also generates accurate 3D molecular structures directly from SMILES or spectral inputs, bridging spectral analysis, molecular elucidation, and molecular design.

SpectraLLM	Specialized		Yes	Structure elucidation is a fundamental technique for understanding the microscopic composition of matter and is widely applied across various disciplines in the natural sciences and engineering. However, existing methods often rely heavily on prior databases or known structural information, making it difficult to resolve unknown structures. In addition, complex structures typically require the joint analysis of multiple spectroscopic modalities. This process heavily depends on expert domain knowledge and is often accompanied by high costs in terms of both time and instrumentation. To address these challenges, we propose SpectraLLM, the first large language model designed to support multi-modal spectroscopic joint reasoning. SpectraLLM is capable of processing either single or multiple spectroscopic inputs and performing end-to-end structure elucidation. By integrating continuous and discrete spectroscopic modalities into a shared semantic space, SpectraLLM learns to uncover substructural patterns that are consistent and complementary across spectra, enabling precise molecular structure elucidation. We pretrain and fine-tune SpectraLLM in the domain of small molecules, and evaluate it on six standardized, publicly available chemical datasets. The model achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming existing approaches trained on single modalities. Notably, SpectraLLM demonstrates strong robustness and generalization even for single-spectrum inference, while its multi-modal reasoning capability further improves the accuracy of structural prediction.

ATLASx	Specialized			Metabolic “dark matter” describes currently unknown metabolic processes, which form a blind spot in our general understanding of metabolism and slow down the development of biosynthetic cell factories and naturally derived pharmaceuticals. Mapping the dark matter of metabolism remains an open challenge that can be addressed globally and systematically by existing computational solutions. In this work, we use 489 generalized enzymatic reaction rules to map both known and unknown metabolic processes around a biochemical database of 1.5 million biological compounds. We predict over 5 million reactions and integrate nearly 2 million naturally and synthetically-derived compounds into the global network of biochemical knowledge, named ATLASx. ATLASx is available to researchers as a powerful online platform that supports the prediction and analysis of biochemical pathways and evaluates the biochemical vicinity of molecule classes (https://lcsb-databases.epfl.ch/Atlas2).

BAGO	Specialized			Liquid chromatography (LC) with gradient elution is a routine practice for separating complex chemical mixtures in mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted analysis. Despite its prevalence, systematic optimization of LC gradients has remained challenging. Here we develop a Bayesian optimization method, BAGO, for autonomous and efficient LC gradient optimization. BAGO is an active learning strategy that discovers the optimal gradient using limited experimental data. From over 100,000 plausible gradients, BAGO locates the optimal LC gradient within ten sample analyses. We validated BAGO on six biological studies of different sample matrices and LC columns, showing that BAGO can significantly improve quantitative performance, tandem MS spectral coverage, and spectral purity. For instance, the optimized gradient increases the count of annotated compounds meeting quantification criteria by up to 48.5%. Furthermore, applying BAGO in a Drosophila metabolomics study, an additional 57 metabolites and 126 lipids were annotated. The BAGO algorithms were implemented into user-friendly software for everyday laboratory practice and a Python package for its flexible extension.

BioTransformer 3.0	Specialized			Abstract BioTransformer 3.0 (https://biotransformer.ca) is a freely available web server that supports accurate, rapid and comprehensive in silico metabolism prediction. It combines machine learning approaches with a rule-based system to predict small-molecule metabolism in human tissues, the human gut as well as the external environment (soil and water microbiota). Simply stated, BioTransformer takes a molecular structure as input (SMILES or SDF) and outputs an interactively sortable table of the predicted metabolites or transformation products (SMILES, PNG images) along with the enzymes that are predicted to be responsible for those reactions and richly annotated downloadable files (CSV and JSON). The entire process typically takes less than a minute. Previous versions of BioTransformer focused exclusively on predicting the metabolism of xenobiotics (such as plant natural products, drugs, cosmetics and other synthetic compounds) using a limited number of pre-defined steps and somewhat limited rule-based methods. BioTransformer 3.0 uses much more sophisticated methods and incorporates new databases, new constraints and new prediction modules to not only more accurately predict the metabolic transformation products of exogenous xenobiotics but also the transformation products of endogenous metabolites, such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, organic acids, and lipids. BioTransformer 3.0 can also support customized sequential combinations of these transformations along with multiple iterations to simulate multi-step human biotransformation events. Performance tests indicate that BioTransformer 3.0 is 40–50% more accurate, far less prone to combinatorial ‘explosions’ and much more comprehensive in terms of metabolite coverage/capabilities than previous versions of BioTransformer.

CCWeights	Specialized			Summary The accuracy of any analytical method is highly dependent on the selection of an appropriate calibration model. Here, we present CCWeights, an R package for automated assessment and selection of weighting factors for accurate quantification using linear calibration curve.

ChemSpectra	Specialized			Abstract ChemSpectra, a web-based software to visualize and analyze spectroscopic data, integrating solutions for infrared spectroscopy (IR), mass spectrometry (MS), and one-dimensional 1H and 13C NMR (proton and carbon nuclear magnetic resonance) spectroscopy, is described. ChemSpectra serves as web-based tool for the analysis of the most often used types of one-dimensional spectroscopic data in synthetic (organic) chemistry research. It was developed to support in particular processes for the use of open file formats which enable the work according to the FAIR data principles. The software can deal with the open file formats JCAMP-DX (IR, MS, NMR) and mzML (MS) proposing these data file types to gain interoperable data. ChemSpectra can be extended to read also other formats as exemplified by selected proprietary mass spectrometry data files of type RAW and NMR spectra files of type FID. The JavaScript-based editor can be integrated with other software, as demonstrated by integration into the Chemotion electronic lab notebook (ELN) and Chemotion repository, demonstrating the implementation into a digital work environment that offers additional functionality and sustainable research data management options. ChemSpectra supports different functions for working with spectroscopic data such as zoom functions, peak picking and automatic peak detection according to a default or manually defined threshold. NMR specific functions include the definition of a reference signal, the integration of signals, coupling constant calculation and multiplicity assignment. Embedded into a web application such as an ELN or a repository, the editor can also be used to generate an association of spectra to a sample and a file management. The file management supports the storage of the original spectra along with the last edited version and an automatically generated image of the spectra in png format. To maximize the benefit of the spectra editor for e.g. ELN users, an automated procedure for the transfer of the detected or manually chosen signals to the ELN was implemented. ChemSpectra is released under the AGPL license to encourage its re-use and further developments by the community.

DeepMet	Specialized			Despite decades of study, large parts of the mammalian metabolome remain unexplored. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics routinely detects thousands of small molecule-associated peaks within human tissues and biofluids, but typically only a small fraction of these can be identified, and structure elucidation of novel metabolites remains a low-throughput endeavor. Biochemical large language models have transformed the interpretation of DNA, RNA, and protein sequences, but have not yet had a comparable impact on understanding small molecule metabolism. Here, we present an approach that leverages chemical language models to discover previously uncharacterized metabolites. We introduce DeepMet, a chemical language model that learns the latent biosynthetic logic embedded within the structures of known metabolites and exploits this understanding to anticipate the existence of as-of-yet undiscovered metabolites. Prospective chemical synthesis of metabolites predicted to exist by DeepMet directs their targeted discovery. Integrating DeepMet with tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) data enables automated metabolite discovery within complex tissues. We harness DeepMet to discover several dozen structurally diverse mammalian metabolites. Our work demonstrates the potential for language models to accelerate the mapping of the metabolome.

MINE 2.0	Specialized			Summary Although advances in untargeted metabolomics have made it possible to gather data on thousands of cellular metabolites in parallel, identification of novel metabolites from these datasets remains challenging. To address this need, Metabolic in silico Network Expansions (MINEs) were developed. A MINE is an expansion of known biochemistry which can be used as a list of potential structures for unannotated metabolomics peaks. Here, we present MINE 2.0, which utilizes a new set of biochemical transformation rules that covers 93% of MetaCyc reactions (compared to 25% in MINE 1.0). This results in a 17-fold increase in database size and a 40% increase in MINE database compounds matching unannotated peaks from an untargeted metabolomics dataset. MINE 2.0 is thus a significant improvement to this community resource. Availability and implementation The MINE 2.0 website can be accessed at https://minedatabase.ci.northwestern.edu. The MINE 2.0 web API documentation can be accessed at https://mine-api.readthedocs.io/en/latest/.

MS-RT	Specialized			The clustering of tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) is a crucial computational step to deduplicate repeated acquisitions in data-dependent experiments. This technique is essential in untargeted metabolomics, particularly with high-throughput mass spectrometers capable of generating hundreds of MS/MS spectra per second. Despite advancements in MS/MS clustering algorithms in proteomics, their performance in metabolomics has not been extensively evaluated due to the lack of database search tools with false discovery rate control for molecule identification. To bridge this gap, this study introduces the MS1-retention time (MS-RT) method to assess MS/MS clustering performance in metabolomics data sets. Here, we validate MS-RT by comparing MS-RT to established proteomics clustering evaluation approaches that utilize database search identifications. Additionally, we evaluate the performance of several MS/MS clustering tools on metabolomics data sets, highlighting their advantages and drawbacks. This MS-RT method and the MS/MS clustering tool benchmarking will provide valuable real world practical recommendations for tools and set the stage for future advancements in metabolomics MS/MS clustering.

MS2toImg	Specialized		Yes	Untargeted metabolomics using LC-MS/MS offers the potential to comprehensively profile the chemical diversity of biological samples. However, the process is fundamentally limited by the "identification bottleneck," where only a small fraction of detected features can be annotated using existing spectral libraries, leaving the majority of data uncharacterized and unused. In addition, the inherently low reproducibility of LC-MS/MS instruments introduces alignment errors between runs, making feature alignment across large datasets both error-prone and challenging. To overcome these constraints, we developed a deep learning method that eliminates the requirement for metabolite identification and reduces the influence of alignment inaccuracies. Here, we propose MS2toImg, a method that converts raw LC-MS/MS data into a two-dimensional images representing the global fragmentation pattern of each sample. These images are then used as direct input for a convolutional neural network (CNN), enabling end-to-end prediction of biological activity without explicit feature engineering or alignment. Our approach was validated using wild soybean samples and multiple bioactivity assays (e.g., DPPH, elastase inhibition). The MS2toImg-CNN model outperformed conventional machine learning baselines (e.g., Random Forest, PCA), demonstrating robust classification accuracy across diverse tasks. By transforming raw spectral data into images, our framework is inherently less sensitive to alignment errors caused by low instrument reproducibility, as it leverages the overall fragmentation landscape rather than relying on precise feature matching. This identification-free, image-based approach enables more robust and scalable bioactivity prediction from untargeted metabolomics data, offering a new paradigm for high-throughput functional screening in complex biological systems.

MSConnect	Specialized			The scale of mass spectrometry-based proteomics data sets continues to increase, and the analysis workflows are becoming more complex as various steps are carried out using a multitude of software programs developed by both commercial providers and the research community. Manually shepherding data across multiple programs and in-house-developed scripts can be error prone and labor intensive. It is also difficult for others to follow the same steps, leading to poor repeatability. We have developed an integrated data management and analysis platform termed MSConnect that enables simple and traceable processing workflows across multiple programs, thus improving repeatability and automating common backup and analysis steps from the point of data collection through summarization and visualization. The open nature of the MSConnect platform enables the diverse omics community to seamlessly integrate third-party tools or develop and automate their own unique workflows.

Pickaxe	Specialized			Background Biochemical reaction prediction tools leverage enzymatic promiscuity rules to generate reaction networks containing novel compounds and reactions. The resulting reaction networks can be used for multiple applications such as designing novel biosynthetic pathways and annotating untargeted metabolomics data. It is vital for these tools to provide a robust, user-friendly method to generate networks for a given application. However, existing tools lack the flexibility to easily generate networks that are tailor-fit for a user’s application due to lack of exhaustive reaction rules, restriction to pre-computed networks, and difficulty in using the software due to lack of documentation. Results Here we present Pickaxe, an open-source, flexible software that provides a user-friendly method to generate novel reaction networks. This software iteratively applies reaction rules to a set of metabolites to generate novel reactions. Users can select rules from the prepackaged JN1224min ruleset, derived from MetaCyc, or define their own custom rules. Additionally, filters are provided which allow for the pruning of a network on-the-fly based on compound and reaction properties. The filters include chemical similarity to target molecules, metabolomics, thermodynamics, and reaction feasibility filters. Example applications are given to highlight the capabilities of Pickaxe: the expansion of common biological databases with novel reactions, the generation of industrially useful chemicals from a yeast metabolome database, and the annotation of untargeted metabolomics peaks from an E. coli dataset. Conclusion  Pickaxe predicts novel metabolic reactions and compounds, which can be used for a variety of applications. This software is open-source and available as part of the MINE Database python package (https://pypi.org/project/minedatabase/) or on GitHub (https://github.com/tyo-nu/MINE-Database). Documentation and examples can be found on Read the Docs (https://mine-database.readthedocs.io/en/latest/). Through its documentation, pre-packaged features, and customizable nature, Pickaxe allows users to generate novel reaction networks tailored to their application.

SPIFFED 	Specialized			Protein complexes are key functional units in cellular processes. High-throughput techniques, such as co-fractionation coupled with mass spectrometry (CF-MS), have advanced protein complex studies by enabling global interactome inference. However, dealing with complex fractionation characteristics to define true interactions is not a simple task, since CF-MS is prone to false positives due to the co-elution of non-interacting proteins by chance. Several computational methods have been designed to analyze CF-MS data and construct probabilistic protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks. Current methods usually first infer PPIs based on handcrafted CF-MS features, and then use clustering algorithms to form potential protein complexes. While powerful, these methods suffer from the potential bias of handcrafted features and severely imbalanced data distribution. However, the handcrafted features based on domain knowledge might introduce bias, and current methods also tend to overfit due to the severely imbalanced PPI data. To address these issues, we present a balanced end-to-end learning architecture, Software for Prediction of Interactome with Feature-extraction Free Elution Data (SPIFFED), to integrate feature representation from raw CF-MS data and interactome prediction by convolutional neural network. SPIFFED outperforms the state-of-the-art methods in predicting PPIs under the conventional imbalanced training. When trained with balanced data, SPIFFED had greatly improved sensitivity for true PPIs. Moreover, the ensemble SPIFFED model provides different voting schemes to integrate predicted PPIs from multiple CF-MS data. Using the clustering software (i.e. ClusterONE), SPIFFED allows users to infer high-confidence protein complexes depending on the CF-MS experimental designs. The source code of SPIFFED is freely available at: https://github.com/bio-it-station/SPIFFED.

ECDFormer	Specialized		Yes	Electronic circular dichroism (ECD) spectra contain key information about molecular chirality by discriminating the absolute configurations of chiral molecules, which is crucial in asymmetric organic synthesis and the drug industry. However, existing predictive approaches lack the consideration of ECD spectra owing to the data scarcity and the limited interpretability to achieve trustworthy prediction. Here we establish a large-scale dataset for chiral molecular ECD spectra and propose ECDFormer for accurate and interpretable ECD spectrum prediction. ECDFormer decomposes ECD spectra into peak entities, uses the QFormer architecture to learn peak properties and renders peaks into spectra. Compared with spectrum sequence prediction methods, our decoupled peak prediction approach substantially enhances both accuracy and efficiency, improving the peak symbol accuracy from 37.3% to 72.7% and decreasing the time cost from an average of 4.6 central processing unit hours to 1.5 s. Moreover, ECDFormer demonstrated its ability to capture molecular orbital information directly from spectral data using the explainable peak-decoupling approach. Furthermore, ECDFormer proved to be equally proficient at predicting various types of spectrum, including infrared and mass spectroscopies, highlighting its substantial generalization capabilities.

Maldi Transformer	Specialized		Yes	For the last decade, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) has been the reference method for species identification in clinical microbiology. Hampered by a historical lack of open data, machine learning research towards models specifically adapted to MALDI-TOF MS remains in its infancy. Given the growing complexity of available datasets (such as large-scale antimicrobial resistance prediction), a need for models that (1) are specifically designed for MALDI-TOF MS data, and (2) have high representational capacity, presents itself. Here, we introduce Maldi Transformer, an adaptation of the state-of-the-art transformer architecture to the MALDI-TOF mass spectral domain. We propose the first self-supervised pre-training technique specifically designed for mass spectra. The technique is based on shuffling peaks across spectra, and pre-training the transformer as a peak discriminator. Extensive benchmarks confirm the efficacy of this novel design. The final result is a model exhibiting state-of-the-art (or competitive) performance on downstream prediction tasks. In addition, we show that Maldi Transformer’s identification of noisy spectra may be leveraged towards higher predictive performance.

MetaboliteChat	Specialized		Yes	Accurately characterizing the mechanisms and properties of metabolite molecules is essential for advancing metabolomics and systems biology. Yet most existing approaches are narrow, task-specific models that do not transfer across tasks and cannot express the richer, multimodal biological context of a metabolite in natural language. To address these challenges, we introduce MetaboliteChat, a multimodal ChatGPT-like large language model (LLM) that provides a unified and interactive framework for metabolite analysis. MetaboliteChat integrates molecular-graph and image reasoning with natural language understanding to generate comprehensive, free-form predictions about metabolite mechanisms and properties. The MetaboliteChat architecture consists of a graph neural network (GNN), a convolutional neural network (CNN), a large language model (LLM), and adapters, all trained end to end. This unified, multimodal design enables interactive reasoning over unseen metabolites, allowing the model to integrate structural and contextual cues and support discovery and translational insights across diverse biological systems.

ChemFOnt	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			The Chemical Functional Ontology (ChemFOnt), located at https://www.chemfont.ca, is a hierarchical, OWL-compatible ontology describing the functions and actions of >341 000 biologically important chemicals. These include primary metabolites, secondary metabolites, natural products, food chemicals, synthetic food additives, drugs, herbicides, pesticides and environmental chemicals. ChemFOnt is a FAIR-compliant resource intended to bring the same rigor, standardization and formal structure to the terms and terminology used in biochemistry, food chemistry and environmental chemistry as the gene ontology (GO) has brought to molecular biology. ChemFOnt is available as both a freely accessible, web-enabled database and a downloadable Web Ontology Language (OWL) file. Users may download and deploy ChemFOnt within their own chemical databases or integrate ChemFOnt into their own analytical software to generate machine readable relationships that can be used to make new inferences, enrich their omics data sets or make new, non-obvious connections between chemicals and their direct or indirect effects. The web version of the ChemFOnt database has been designed to be easy to search, browse and navigate. Currently ChemFOnt contains data on 341 627 chemicals, including 515 332 terms or definitions. The functional hierarchy for ChemFOnt consists of four functional ‘aspects’, 12 functional super-categories and a total of 173 705 functional terms. In addition, each of the chemicals are classified into 4825 structure-based chemical classes. ChemFOnt currently contains 3.9 million protein-chemical relationships and ∼10.3 million chemical-functional relationships. The long-term goal for ChemFOnt is for it to be adopted by databases and software tools used by the general chemistry community as well as the metabolomics, exposomics, metagenomics, genomics and proteomics communities.

EnrichMET	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Advances in metabolomics have significantly improved our understanding of cellular processes by enabling the identification of hundreds of metabolites in a single experiment. These developments provide valuable insights into complex metabolic networks. Pathway Enrichment Analysis (PEA) is essential for connecting identified metabolites with biological pathways, uncovering meaningful relationships, and revealing underlying metabolic mechanisms. However, existing tools, often require multiple steps, rely on web-based interfaces, and require R packages that can be challenging to install due to outdated or missing dependencies. This hampers both reproducibility and efficiency. To overcome these limitations, we introduce EnrichMet, an R package designed for efficient and reproducible pathway, metabolite set enrichment analysis (MetSEA). The package integrates fgsea for rapid MetSEA and igraph for topology-based metrics, enabling comprehensive integration of metabolomics data. EnrichMet utilizes curated pathway data from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and employs Fishers Exact Test to identify significantly enriched pathways. Through a case study on experimental metabolomics datasets, we demonstrate the robustness and efficiency of EnrichMet, benchmarking it against existing tools. The results show that EnrichMet provides accurate and comprehensive pathway enrichment outcomes while reducing computational time and user effort. Moreover, its flexible framework allows EnrichMet to be adaptable to a broad range of data types and applications beyond KEGG. By streamlining the pathway analysis process, EnrichMet enables researchers to derive deeper insights from metabolomics data, promoting reproducible and efficient research practices.

GINv2.0	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Knowledge bases have been instrumental in advancing biological research, facilitating pathway analysis and data visualization, which are now widely employed in the scientific community. Despite the establishment of several prominent knowledge bases focusing on signaling, metabolic networks, or both, integrating these networks into a unified topological network has proven to be challenging. The intricacy of molecular interactions and the diverse formats employed to store and display them contribute to the complexity of this task. In a prior study, we addressed this challenge by introducing a “meta-pathway” structure that integrated the advantages of the Simple Interaction Format (SIF) while accommodating reaction information. Nevertheless, the earlier Global Integrative Network (GIN) was limited to reliance on KEGG alone. Here, we present GIN version 2.0, which incorporates human molecular interaction data from ten distinct knowledge bases, including KEGG, Reactome, and HumanCyc, among others. We standardized the data structure, gene IDs, and chemical IDs, and conducted a comprehensive analysis of the consistency among the ten knowledge bases before combining all unified interactions into GINv2.0. Utilizing GINv2.0, we investigated the glycolysis process and its regulatory proteins, revealing coordinated regulations on glycolysis and autophagy, particularly under glucose starvation. The expanded scope and enhanced capabilities of GINv2.0 provide a valuable resource for comprehensive systems-level analyses in the field of biological research.

IDSL.GOA	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Biological interpretation of metabolomic datasets often ends at a pathway analysis step to find the over-represented metabolic pathways in the list of statistically significant metabolites. However, definitions of biochemical pathways and metabolite coverage vary among different curated databases, leading to missed interpretations. For the lists of genes, transcripts and proteins, Gene Ontology (GO) terms over-presentation analysis has become a standardized approach for biological interpretation. But, GO analysis has not been achieved for metabolomic datasets. We present a new knowledgebase (KB) and the online tool, Gene Ontology Analysis by the Integrated Data Science Laboratory for Metabolomics and Exposomics (IDSL.GOA) to conduct GO over-representation analysis for a metabolite list. The IDSL.GOA KB covers 2393 metabolic GO terms and associated 3144 genes, 1,492 EC annotations, and 2621 metabolites. IDSL.GOA analysis of a case study of older versus young female brain cortex metabolome highlighted 82 GO terms being significantly overrepresented (FDR < 0.05). We showed how IDSL.GOA identified key and relevant GO metabolic processes that were not yet covered in other pathway databases. Overall, we suggest that interpretation of metabolite lists should not be limited to only pathway maps and can also leverage GO terms as well. IDSL.GOA provides a useful tool for this purpose, allowing for a more comprehensive and accurate analysis of metabolite pathway data. IDSL.GOA tool can be accessed at https://goa.idsl.me/.

iMSEA	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Drug combinations are commonly used to treat various diseases to achieve synergistic therapeutic effects or to alleviate drug resistance. Nevertheless, some drug combinations might lead to adverse effects, and thus, it is crucial to explore the mechanisms of drug interactions before clinical treatment. Generally, drug interactions have been studied using nonclinical pharmacokinetics, toxicology, and pharmacology. Here, we propose a complementary strategy based on metabolomics, which we call interaction metabolite set enrichment analysis, or iMSEA, to decipher drug interactions. First, a digraph-based heterogeneous network model was constructed to model the biological metabolic network based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database. Second, treatment-specific influences on all detected metabolites were calculated and propagated across the whole network model. Third, pathway activity was defined and enriched to quantify the influence of each treatment on the predefined functional metabolite sets, i.e., metabolic pathways. Finally, drug interactions were identified by comparing the pathway activity enriched by the drug combination treatments and the single drug treatments. A data set consisting of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cells that were treated with oxaliplatin (OXA) and/or vitamin C (VC) was used to illustrate the effectiveness of the iMSEA strategy for evaluation of drug interactions. Performance evaluation using synthetic noise data was also performed to evaluate sensitivities and parameter settings for the iMSEA strategy. The iMSEA strategy highlighted synergistic effects of combined OXA and VC treatments including the alterations in the glycerophospholipid metabolism pathway and glycine, serine, and threonine metabolism pathway. This work provides an alternative method to reveal the mechanisms of drug combinations from the viewpoint of metabolomics.	iMSEA: A Novel Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis Strategy to Decipher Drug Interactions 	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.2c04603	Analytical Chemistry	Wang, Y., Liu, X., Dong, L., Cheng, K., Lin, C., Wang, X., ...

This new version contains updated annotations from previously included databases as well as a wide variety of new functional annotations, such as additional pathway databases and Gene Ontology terms. Of special relevance is the inclusion of a new category of annotations, ‘indirect annotations’, extracted from the scientific literature and from curated chemical-protein associations. The latter allows to analyze enriched annotations of the proteins known to interact with the set of chemical compounds of interest.

metGWAS 1.0	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Motivation  The method of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and metabolomics combined provide an quantitative approach to pinpoint metabolic pathways and genes linked to specific diseases; however, such analyses require both genomics and metabolomics datasets from the same individuals/samples. In most cases, this approach is not feasible due to high costs, lack of technical infrastructure, unavailability of samples, and other factors. Therefore, an unmet need exists for a bioinformatics tool that can identify gene loci-associated polymorphic variants for metabolite alterations seen in disease states using standalone metabolomics. Results  Here, we developed a bioinformatics tool, metGWAS 1.0, that integrates independent GWAS data from the GWAS database and standalone metabolomics data using a network-based systems biology approach to identify novel disease/trait-specific metabolite-gene associations. The tool was evaluated using standalone metabolomics datasets extracted from two metabolomics-GWAS case studies. It discovered both the observed and novel gene loci with known single nucleotide polymorphisms when compared to the original studies. Availability and implementation  The developed metGWAS 1.0 framework is implemented in an R pipeline and available at: https://github.com/saifurbd28/metGWAS-1.0.	metGWAS 1.0: An R workflow for network-driven over-representation analysis between independent metabolomic and meta-genome-wide association studies	https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/advance-article/doi/10.1093/bioinformatics/btad523/7248906?login=false	Bioinformatics	Khan, S.R., Obersterescu, A., Gunderson, E.P., Razani, B., Wheeler, M.B., Cox, B.J.

metLinkR	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Metabolites are referenced in spectral, structural and pathway databases with a diverse array of schemas, including various internal database identifiers and large tables of common name synonyms. Cross-linking metabolite identifiers is a required step for meta-analysis of metabolomic results across studies but made difficult due to the lack of a consensus identifier system. We have implemented metLinkR, an R package that leverages RefMet and RaMP-DB to automate and simplify cross-linking metabolite identifiers across studies and generating common names. MetLinkR accepts as input metabolite common names and identifiers from five different databases (HMDB, KEGG, ChEBI, LIPIDMAPS and PubChem) to exhaustively search for possible overlap in supplied metabolites from input data sets. In an example of 13 metabolomic data sets totaling 10,400 metabolites, metLinkR identified and provided common names for 1377 metabolites in common between at least 2 data sets in less than 18 min and produced standardized names for 74.4% of the input metabolites. In another example comprising five data sets with 3512 metabolites, metLinkR identified 715 metabolites in common between at least two data sets in under 12 min and produced standardized names for 82.3% of the input metabolites. Outputs of MetLInR include output tables and metrics allowing users to readily double check the mappings and to get an overview of chemical classes represented. Overall, MetLinkR provides a streamlined solution for a common task in metabolomic epidemiology and other fields that meta-analyze metabolomic data.

MIMOSA2	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Motivation Recent technological developments have facilitated an expansion of microbiome–metabolome studies, in which samples are assayed using both genomic and metabolomic technologies to characterize the abundances of microbial taxa and metabolites. A common goal of these studies is to identify microbial species or genes that contribute to differences in metabolite levels across samples. Previous work indicated that integrating these datasets with reference knowledge on microbial metabolic capacities may enable more precise and confident inference of microbe–metabolite links. Results  We present MIMOSA2, an R package and web application for model-based integrative analysis of microbiome–metabolome datasets. MIMOSA2 uses genomic and metabolic reference databases to construct a community metabolic model based on microbiome data and uses this model to predict differences in metabolite levels across samples. These predictions are compared with metabolomics data to identify putative microbiome-governed metabolites and taxonomic contributors to metabolite variation. MIMOSA2 supports various input data types and customization with user-defined metabolic pathways. We establish MIMOSA2’s ability to identify ground truth microbial mechanisms in simulation datasets, compare its results with experimentally inferred mechanisms in honeybee microbiota, and demonstrate its application in two human studies of inflammatory bowel disease. Overall, MIMOSA2 combines reference databases, a validated statistical framework, and a user-friendly interface to facilitate modeling and evaluating relationships between members of the microbiota and their metabolic products. Availability and implementation  MIMOSA2 is implemented in R under the GNU General Public License v3.0 and is freely available as a web server at http://elbo-spice.cs.tau.ac.il/shiny/MIMOSA2shiny/ and as an R package from http://www.borensteinlab.com/software_MIMOSA2.html.

MiNEApy	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Motivation Modeling genome-scale metabolic networks (GEMs) helps understand metabolic fluxes in cells at a specific state under defined environmental conditions or perturbations. Elementary flux modes (EFMs) are powerful tools for simplifying complex metabolic networks into smaller, more manageable pathways. However, the enumeration of all EFMs, especially within GEMs, poses significant challenges due to computational complexity. Additionally, traditional EFM approaches often fail to capture essential aspects of metabolism, such as co-factor balancing and by-product generation. The previously developed Minimum Network Enrichment Analysis (MiNEA) method addresses these limitations by enumerating alternative minimal networks for given biomass building blocks and metabolic tasks. MiNEA facilitates a deeper understanding of metabolic task flexibility and context-specific metabolic routes by integrating condition-specific transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics data. This approach offers significant improvements in the analysis of metabolic pathways, providing more comprehensive insights into cellular metabolism. Results  Here, I present MiNEApy, a Python package reimplementation of MiNEA, which computes minimal networks and performs enrichment analysis. I demonstrate the application of MiNEApy on both a small-scale and a genome-scale model of the bacterium Escherichia coli, showcasing its ability to conduct minimal network enrichment analysis using minimal networks and context-specific data.

MS2MP	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools		Yes	MS/MS-based untargeted metabolomics generates complex data, but pathway enrichment analysis is constrained by the low annotation rates of metabolic features. Here, we propose MS2MP, a novel deep learning-based framework for KEGG pathway prediction directly from untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS2), eliminating the need for prior metabolite annotation. MS2MP utilizes a graph neural network architecture to learn the complex relationships between spectral features and metabolic pathways, representing MS2 spectra as fragmentation tree graphs. Trained on 33,221 experimental MS2 spectra, MS2MP achieves robust predictive performance with a balanced accuracy of 94.1% in cross-validation and 87.8%–91.2% on three independent test sets. Notably, MS2MP achieves an “exact match” for 97–98 out of 161 tested metabolite standards across diverse experimental conditions, underscoring its reliability and adaptability. Subsequently, a novel MS2-based pathway enrichment method was developed. The established methods were applied to identify significantly perturbed pathways in transgenic maize. The results uncovered disruptions in phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and related downstream pathways, including those involved in amino acid and secondary metabolite metabolism, which were overlooked by the conventional annotation-based enrichment analysis method. To the best of our knowledge, MS2MP is the first computational tool capable of directly predicting metabolic pathways from MS2 spectra. By linking MS2-based untargeted metabolomics data to metabolic pathways, MS2MP enables more efficient pathway enrichment analysis, thereby accelerating biological discoveries and enhancing our understanding of complex metabolic networks.

ORA	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Over-representation analysis (ORA) is one of the commonest pathway analysis approaches used for the functional interpretation of metabolomics datasets. Despite the widespread use of ORA in metabolomics, the community lacks guidelines detailing its best-practice use. Many factors have a pronounced impact on the results, but to date their effects have received little systematic attention. Using five publicly available datasets, we demonstrated that changes in parameters such as the background set, differential metabolite selection methods, and pathway database used can result in profoundly different ORA results. The use of a non-assay-specific background set, for example, resulted in large numbers of false-positive pathways. Pathway database choice, evaluated using three of the most popular metabolic pathway databases (KEGG, Reactome, and BioCyc), led to vastly different results in both the number and function of significantly enriched pathways. Factors that are specific to metabolomics data, such as the reliability of compound identification and the chemical bias of different analytical platforms also impacted ORA results. Simulated metabolite misidentification rates as low as 4% resulted in both gain of false-positive pathways and loss of truly significant pathways across all datasets. Our results have several practical implications for ORA users, as well as those using alternative pathway analysis methods. We offer a set of recommendations for the use of ORA in metabolomics, alongside a set of minimal reporting guidelines, as a first step towards the standardisation of pathway analysis in metabolomics.    Author summaryMetabolomics is a rapidly growing field of study involving the profiling of small molecules within an organism. It allows researchers to understand the effects of biological status (such as health or disease) on cellular biochemistry, and has wide-ranging applications, from biomarker discovery and personalised medicine in healthcare to crop protection and food security in agriculture. Pathway analysis helps to understand which biological pathways, representing collections of molecules performing a particular function, are involved in response to a disease phenotype, or drug treatment, for example. Over-representation analysis (ORA) is perhaps the most common pathway analysis method used in the metabolomics community. However, ORA can give drastically different results depending on the input data and parameters used. In this work, we have established the effects of these factors on ORA results using computational simulations applied to five real-world datasets. Based on our results, we offer the research community a set of best-practice recommendations applicable not only to ORA but also to other pathway analysis methods to help ensure the reliability and reproducibility of results.

PaintOmics 4	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			PaintOmics is a web server for the integrative analysis and visualisation of multi-omics datasets using biological pathway maps. PaintOmics 4 has several notable updates that improve and extend analyses. Three pathway databases are now supported: KEGG, Reactome and MapMan, providing more comprehensive pathway knowledge for animals and plants. New metabolite analysis methods fill gaps in traditional pathway-based enrichment methods. The metabolite hub analysis selects compounds with a high number of significant genes in their neighbouring network, suggesting regulation by gene expression changes. The metabolite class activity analysis tests the hypothesis that a metabolic class has a higher-than-expected proportion of significant elements, indicating that these compounds are regulated in the experiment. Finally, PaintOmics 4 includes a regulatory omics module to analyse the contribution of trans-regulatory layers (microRNA and transcription factors, RNA-binding proteins) to regulate pathways. We show the performance of PaintOmics 4 on both mouse and plant data to highlight how these new analysis features provide novel insights into regulatory biology. PaintOmics 4 is available at https://paintomics.org/.

PALS	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Related metabolites can be grouped into sets in many ways, e.g., by their participation in series of chemical reactions (forming metabolic pathways), or based on fragmentation spectral similarities or shared chemical substructures. Understanding how such metabolite sets change in relation to experimental factors can be incredibly useful in the interpretation and understanding of complex metabolomics data sets. However, many of the available tools that are used to perform this analysis are not entirely suitable for the analysis of untargeted metabolomics measurements. Here, we present PALS (Pathway Activity Level Scoring), a Python library, command line tool, and Web application that performs the ranking of significantly changing metabolite sets over different experimental conditions. The main algorithm in PALS is based on the pathway level analysis of gene expression (PLAGE) factorisation method and is denoted as mPLAGE (PLAGE for metabolomics). As an example of an application, PALS is used to analyse metabolites grouped as metabolic pathways and by shared tandem mass spectrometry fragmentation patterns. A comparison of mPLAGE with two other commonly used methods (overrepresentation analysis (ORA) and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)) is also given and reveals that mPLAGE is more robust to missing features and noisy data than the alternatives. As further examples, PALS is also applied to human African trypanosomiasis, Rhamnaceae, and American Gut Project data. In addition, normalisation can have a significant impact on pathway analysis results, and PALS offers a framework to further investigate this. PALS is freely available from our project Web site.

PathBank 2.0	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			PathBank (https://pathbank.org) and its predecessor database, the Small Molecule Pathway Database (SMPDB), have been providing comprehensive metabolite pathway information for the metabolomics community since 2010. Over the past 14 years, these pathway databases have grown and evolved significantly to meet the needs of the metabolomics community and respond to continuing changes in computing technology. This year's update, PathBank 2.0, brings a number of important improvements and upgrades that should make the database more useful and more appealing to a larger cross-section of users. In particular, these improvements include: (i) a significant increase in the number of primary or canonical pathways (from 1720 to 6951); (ii) a massive increase in the total number of pathways (from 110 234 to 605 359); (iii) significant improvements to the quality of pathway diagrams and pathway descriptions; (iv) a strong emphasis on drug metabolism and drug mechanism pathways; (v) making most pathway images more slide-compatible and manuscript-compatible; (vi) adding tools to support better pathway filtering and selecting through a more complete pathway taxonomy; (vii) adding pathway analysis tools for visualizing and calculating pathway enrichment. Many other minor improvements and updates to the content, the interface and general performance of the PathBank website have also been made. Overall, we believe these upgrades and updates should greatly enhance PathBank's ease of use and its potential applications for interpreting metabolomics data.

SBGNview	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Summary Pathway analysis is widely used in genomics and omics research, but the data visualization has been highly limited in function, pathway coverage and data format. Here, we develop SBGNview a comprehensive R package to address these needs. By adopting the standard SBGN format, SBGNview greatly extend the coverage of pathway-based analysis and data visualization to essentially all major pathway databases beyond KEGG, including 5200 reference pathways and over 3000 species. In addition, SBGNview substantially extends or exceeds current tools (esp. Pathview) in both design and function, including standard input format (SBGN), high-quality output graphics (SVG format) convenient for both interpretation and further update, and flexible and open-end workflow for iterative editing and interactive visualization (Highlighter module). In addition to pathway analysis and data visualization, SBGNview provides essential infrastructure for SBGN data manipulation and processing.

secCellFie	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Understanding protein secretion has considerable importance in biotechnology and important implications in a broad range of normal and pathological conditions including development, immunology, and tissue function. While great progress has been made in studying individual proteins in the secretory pathway, measuring and quantifying mechanistic changes in the pathway's activity remains challenging due to the complexity of the biomolecular systems involved. Systems biology has begun to address this issue with the development of algorithmic tools for analyzing biological pathways; however most of these tools remain accessible only to experts in systems biology with extensive computational experience. Here, we expand upon the user-friendly CellFie tool which quantifies metabolic activity from omic data to include secretory pathway functions, allowing any scientist to infer properties of protein secretion from omic data. We demonstrate how the secretory expansion of CellFie (secCellFie) can help predict metabolic and secretory functions across diverse immune cells, hepatokine secretion in a cell model of NAFLD, and antibody production in Chinese Hamster Ovary cells.

Viime-Path	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Introduction A primary objective of metabolomics studies is identifying the critical metabolic pathways that are altered under specific conditions. There are a number of tools such as enrichment or over-representation algorithms which can identify pathways, but tools for visualizing these pathways beyond static diagrams are limited.    Objectives Development of an open-source software tool to enable users to generate metabolic pathway diagrams that can be interactively adjusted to allow for the most lucid and meaningful representation of the data. The ability to input and integrate multiple metabolic pathways and interactively adjust could facilitate the identification of novel metabolic pathways.    Methods The Viime-Path software package utilizes the metabolic pathways in the Reactome Database. The initial pathway layouts are generated using the Human-like Orthogonal Network Layout (HOLA) algorithm which was designed to take such datasets and map them onto orthogonal network layouts using aesthetic principles derived from the analysis of human-generated networks. The software is written in TypeScript and Vue, utilizing the WebCola graph layout library and D3.js for visualization primitives.    ResultsWe have created an easy-to-use, web-based, open-source tool to easily import metabolic pathways from the Reactome database. The tool allows for interactive optimization of pathways to best represent the most salient features for a given analysis. The tool is available on GitHub at https://github.com/girder/viime-path.    ConclusionsThe Viime-Path tool will enable the metabolomics community to interactively draw metabolic pathway networks with options to adjust specific components and layout, thus providing new levels of clarity and focus.

WebGestalt	Pathway, Enrichment and Ontology Tools			Enrichment analysis, crucial for interpreting genomic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data, is expanding into metabolomics. Furthermore, there is a rising demand for integrated enrichment analysis that combines data from different studies and omics platforms, as seen in meta-analysis and multi-omics research. To address these growing needs, we have updated WebGestalt to include enrichment analysis capabilities for both metabolites and multiple input lists of analytes. We have also significantly increased analysis speed, revamped the user interface, and introduced new pathway visualizations to accommodate these updates. Notably, the adoption of a Rust backend reduced gene set enrichment analysis time by 95% from 270.64 to 12.41 s and network topology-based analysis by 89% from 159.59 to 17.31 s in our evaluation. This performance improvement is also accessible in both the R package and a newly introduced Python package. Additionally, we have updated the data in the WebGestalt database to reflect the current status of each source and have expanded our collection of pathways, networks, and gene signatures. The 2024 WebGestalt update represents a significant leap forward, offering new support for metabolomics, streamlined multi-omics analysis capabilities, and remarkable performance enhancements.

MCnebula	Patterns			Untargeted mass spectrometry is a robust tool for biology, but it usually requires a large amount of time on data analysis, especially for system biology. A framework called Multiple-Chemical nebula (MCnebula) was developed herein to facilitate the LC–MS data analysis process by focusing on critical chemical classes and visualization in multiple dimensions. This framework consists of three vital steps as follows: (1) abundance-based classes (ABC) selection algorithm, (2) critical chemical classes to classify “features” (corresponding to compounds), and (3) visualization as multiple Child-Nebulae (network graph) with annotation, chemical classification, and structure. Notably, MCnebula can be used to explore the classification and structural characteristic of unknown compounds beyond the limit of the spectral library. Moreover, it is intuitive and convenient for pathway analysis and biomarker discovery because of its function of ABC selection and visualization. MCnebula was implemented in the R language. A series of tools in R packages were provided to facilitate downstream analysis in an MCnebula-featured way, including feature selection, homology tracing of top features, pathway enrichment analysis, heat map clustering analysis, spectral visualization analysis, chemical information query, and output analysis reports. The broad utility of MCnebula was illustrated by a human-derived serum data set for metabolomics analysis. The results indicated that “Acyl carnitines” were screened out by tracing structural classes of biomarkers, which was consistent with the reference. A plant-derived data set was investigated to achieve a rapid annotation and discovery of compounds in E. ulmoides.

Metabokiller	Patterns			The genome of a eukaryotic cell is often vulnerable to both intrinsic and extrinsic threats owing to its constant exposure to a myriad of heterogeneous compounds. Despite the availability of innate DNA damage responses, some genomic lesions trigger malignant transformation of cells. Accurate prediction of carcinogens is an ever-challenging task owing to the limited information about bona fide (non-)carcinogens. We developed Metabokiller, an ensemble classifier that accurately recognizes carcinogens by quantitatively assessing their electrophilicity, their potential to induce proliferation, oxidative stress, genomic instability, epigenome alterations, and anti-apoptotic response. Concomitant with the carcinogenicity prediction, Metabokiller is fully interpretable and outperforms existing best-practice methods for carcinogenicity prediction. Metabokiller unraveled potential carcinogenic human metabolites. To cross-validate Metabokiller predictions, we performed multiple functional assays using Saccharomyces cerevisiae and human cells with two Metabokiller-flagged human metabolites, namely 4-nitrocatechol and 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, and observed high synergy between Metabokiller predictions and experimental validations. Metabokiller is a novel, explainable AI-backed method for carcinogenicity prediction that leverages the biological and chemical properties associated with carcinogens.

MS2LDA 2.0	Patterns			Untargeted mass spectrometry measures many spectra of unknown molecules. To annotate them, tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) generates fragmentation patterns representing common substructures. MS2LDA discovers these patterns via unsupervised topic modelling as Mass2Motifs. However, MS/MS-based substructure identification is limited by computational efficiency and interpretability. Here, we report an up to 14× speed improvement through improved algorithmic efficiency. Furthermore, the new automated Mass2Motif Annotation Guidance (MAG) aids in structurally identifying Mass2Motifs. Using three chemically diverse curated MotifDB-MotifSets for benchmarking, MAG achieved median substructure overlap scores of 0.75, 0.93 and 0.95, demonstrating robust substructural annotations. We further validated MS2LDA 2.0 in experimental data by identifying substructures of pesticides spiked into a biological matrix and demonstrated its discovery potential by annotating previously uncharacterized fungal natural products. Together with the new visualization app and MassQL-searchable MotifDB, we anticipate that MS2LDA 2.0 will boost the identification of novel chemistry and hidden patterns in mass spectrometry profiles.

mzBucket	Patterns			Abstract   Background   Mass spectrometry is an important experimental technique in the field of proteomics. However, analysis of certain mass spectrometry data faces a combination of two challenges: first, even a single experiment produces a large amount of multi-dimensional raw data and, second, signals of interest are not single peaks but patterns of peaks that span along the different dimensions. The rapidly growing amount of mass spectrometry data increases the demand for scalable solutions. Furthermore, existing approaches for signal detection usually rely on strong assumptions concerning the signals properties.      Results   In this study, it is shown that locality-sensitive hashing enables signal classification in mass spectrometry raw data at scale. Through appropriate choice of algorithm parameters it is possible to balance false-positive and false-negative rates. On synthetic data, a superior performance compared to an intensity thresholding approach was achieved. Real data could be strongly reduced without losing relevant information. Our implementation scaled out up to 32 threads and supports acceleration by GPUs.      Conclusions   Locality-sensitive hashing is a desirable approach for signal classification in mass spectrometry raw data.

mGWAS-Explorer 2.0	Specialized			Metabolomics-based genome-wide association studies (mGWAS) are key to understanding the genetic regulations of metabolites in complex phenotypes. We previously developed mGWAS-Explorer 1.0 to link single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), metabolites, genes and phenotypes for hypothesis generation. It has become clear that identifying potential causal relationships between metabolites and phenotypes, as well as providing deep functional insights, are crucial for further downstream applications. Here, we introduce mGWAS-Explorer 2.0 to support the causal analysis between >4000 metabolites and various phenotypes. The results can be interpreted within the context of semantic triples and molecular quantitative trait loci (QTL) data. The underlying R package is released for reproducible analysis. Using two case studies, we demonstrate that mGWAS-Explorer 2.0 is able to detect potential causal relationships between arachidonic acid and Crohn’s disease, as well as between glycine and coronary heart disease.	mGWAS-Explorer 2.0: Causal Analysis and Interpretation of Metabolite–Phenotype Associations	https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/13/7/826	Metabolites	Chang, L., Zhou, G., Xia, J.

AriumMS	Pre-processing			In mass spectrometry (MS)-based metabolomics, there is a great need to combine different analytical separation techniques to cover metabolites of different polarities and apply appropriate multi-platform data processing. Here, we introduce AriumMS (augmented region of interest for untargeted metabolomics mass spectrometry) as a reliable toolbox for multi-platform metabolomics. AriumMS offers augmented data analysis of several separation techniques utilizing a region-of-interest algorithm. To demonstrate the capabilities of AriumMS, five datasets were combined. This includes three newly developed capillary electrophoresis (CE)-Orbitrap MS methods using the recently introduced nanoCEasy CE-MS interface and two hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC)-Orbitrap MS methods. AriumMS provides a novel mid-level data fusion approach for multi-platform data analysis to simplify and speed up multi-platform data processing and evaluation. The key feature of AriumMS lies in the optimized data processing strategy, including parallel processing of datasets and flexible parameterization for processing of individual separation methods with different peak characteristics. As a case study, Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast) was treated with a growth inhibitor, and AriumMS successfully differentiated the metabolome based on the augmented multi-platform CE-MS and HILIC-MS investigation. As a result, AriumMS is proposed as a powerful tool to improve the accuracy and selectivity of metabolome analysis through the integration of several HILIC-MS/CE-MS techniques.

asari	Pre-processing			Significant challenges remain in the computational processing of data from liquid chomratography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomic experiments into metabolite features. In this study, we examine the issues of provenance and reproducibility using the current software tools. Inconsistency among the tools examined is attributed to the deficiencies of mass alignment and controls of feature quality. To address these issues, we develop the open-source software tool asari for LC-MS metabolomics data processing. Asari is designed with a set of specific algorithmic framework and data structures, and all steps are explicitly trackable. Asari compares favorably to other tools in feature detection and quantification. It offers substantial improvement in computational performance over current tools, and it is highly scalable. Reproducible and scalable data processing is key to the progress of metabolomics. Here, the authors present a software tool that offers predictable metabolomics feature detection and improved computational performance in large datasets.

AVIR	Pre-processing			Processing liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data using computational programs often introduces additional quantitative uncertainty, termed computational variation in a previous work. This work develops a computational solution to automatically recognize metabolic features with computational variation in a metabolomics data set. This tool, AVIR (short for “Accurate eValuation of alIgnment and integRation”), is a support vector machine-based machine learning strategy (https://github.com/HuanLab/AVIR). The rationale is that metabolic features with computational variation have a poor correlation between chromatographic peak area and peak height-based quantifications across the samples in a study. AVIR was trained on a set of 696 manually curated metabolic features and achieved an accuracy of 94% in a 10-fold cross-validation. When tested on various external data sets from public metabolomics repositories, AVIR demonstrated an accuracy range of 84%–97%. Finally, tested on a large-scale metabolomics study, AVIR clearly indicated features with computational variation and thus guided us to manually correct them. Our results show that 75.3% of the samples with computational variation had a relative intensity difference of over 20% after correction. This demonstrates the critical role of AVIR in reducing computational variation to improve quantitative certainty in untargeted metabolomics analysis.

CorrDIA	Pre-processing			Although data-independent acquisition (DIA) has the ability to identify and quantify all peptides in a sample, highly complex mixed mass spectra present difficulties for accurate peptide and protein identification. Additionally, the correspondence between the precursor and its fragments is broken, making it challenging to perform peptide identification directly using conventional DDA search engines. In this paper, we propose a cosine-similarity-based deconvolution method: CorrDIA. This is achieved by reconstructing the correspondence between precursor and fragment ions based on the consistency of extracted ion chromatograms (XICs). A deisotope peak cluster operation is added and centered on the MS/MS spectrum to improve the accuracy of spectrum interpretation and increase the number of identified peptides. The resulting MS/MS spectra can be identified using any data-dependent acquisition (DDA) sequencing software. The experimental results demonstrate that the number of peptide results increased by 12 percent and 21 percent respectively, and the repetition rate decreased by 12 percent. This reduces mass spectra complexity and difficulties in mass spectra analysis without the need for any mass spectra libraries.

CycloBranch	Pre-processing			Gaussian and exponentially modified Gaussian functions were incorporated into integrating algorithms used by an open-source, cross-platform tool called CycloBranch. The quantitation is demonstrated on bacterial pyoverdines separated by fine isotope features. Using our algorithm, we can separate the m/z values 694.25802 and 694.26731 (a 0.009 Da difference), where the former belongs to the most intense peak of pyoverdine D (PvdD), and the latter to the second most intense peak of pyoverdine E (PvdE) in the respective isotopic clusters of [M + Fe-H]2+ ions. The areas under chromatographic curves of standards were analyzed for the limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), and regression coefficient calculations. The quantitative module returned a LOD and LOQ of 1.4 and 4.3 ng/mL, respectively, for both PvdD and PvdE in human urine. If present and detected in mass spectra, the intensities of user-defined [M + H]+, [M + Na]+, [M + K]+, [M + Fe-H]2+, or other ion types, can be accumulated and used for quantitation. The quantitation result is returned by CycloBranch in seconds or minutes, contrary to an hours-long manual approach, prone to user-born errors originating from necessary copying among various software environments. Native Bruker, Waters, Thermo, txt, mgf, mzML, and mzXML data formats are supported in CycloBranch, which is freely available at https://ms.biomed.cas.cz/cyclobranch .

DaDIA	Pre-processing			Existing data acquisition modes such as full-scan, data-dependent (DDA), and data-independent acquisition (DIA) often present limited capabilities in capturing metabolic information in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics. In this work, we proposed a novel metabolomic data acquisition workflow that combines DDA and DIA analyses to achieve better metabolomic data quality, including enhanced metabolome coverage, tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) coverage, and MS2 quality. This workflow, named data-dependent-assisted data-independent acquisition (DaDIA), performs untargeted metabolomic analysis of individual biological samples using DIA mode and the pooled quality control (QC) samples using DDA mode. This combination takes advantage of the high-feature number and MS2 spectral coverage of the DIA data and the high MS2 spectral quality of the DDA data. To analyze the heterogeneous DDA and DIA data, we further developed a computational program, DaDIA.R, to automatically extract metabolic features and perform streamlined metabolite annotation of DaDIA data set. Using human urine samples, we demonstrated that the DaDIA workflow delivers remarkably improved data quality when compared to conventional DDA or DIA metabolomics. In particular, both the number of detected features and annotated metabolites were greatly increased. Further biological demonstration using a leukemia metabolomics study also proved that the DaDIA workflow can efficiently detect and annotate around 4 times more significant metabolites than DDA workflow with broad MS2 coverage and high MS2 spectral quality for downstream statistical analysis and biological interpretation. Overall, this work represents a critical development of data acquisition mode in untargeted metabolomics, which can greatly benefit untargeted metabolomics for a wide range of biological applications.

DBDIpy	Pre-processing			Motivation Plasma ionization is rapidly gaining popularity for mass spectrometry (MS)-based studies of volatiles and aerosols. However, data from plasma ionization are delicate to interpret as competing ionization pathways in the plasma create numerous ion species. There is no tool for detection of adducts and in-source fragments from plasma ionization data yet, which makes data evaluation ambiguous. Summary  We developed DBDIpy, a Python library for processing and formal analysis of untargeted, time-sensitive plasma ionization MS datasets. Its core functionality lies in the identification of in-source fragments and identification of rivaling ionization pathways of the same analytes in time-sensitive datasets. It further contains elementary functions for processing of untargeted metabolomics data and interfaces to an established ecosystem for analysis of MS data in Python. Availability and implementation  DBDIpy is implemented in Python (Version ≥ 3.7) and can be downloaded from PyPI the Python package repository (https://pypi.org/project/DBDIpy) or from GitHub (https://github.com/leopold-weidner/DBDIpy).

DecoID	Pre-processing			Chimeric MS/MS spectra contain fragments from multiple precursor ions and therefore hinder compound identification in metabolomics. Historically, deconvolution of these chimeric spectra has been challenging and relied on specific experimental methods that introduce variation in the ratios of precursor ions between multiple tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) scans. DecoID provides a complementary, method-independent approach where database spectra are computationally mixed to match an experimentally acquired spectrum by using LASSO regression. We validated that DecoID increases the number of identified metabolites in MS/MS datasets from both data-independent and data-dependent acquisition without increasing the false discovery rate. We applied DecoID to publicly available data from the MetaboLights repository and to data from human plasma, where DecoID increased the number of identified metabolites from data-dependent acquisition data by over 30% compared to direct spectral matching. DecoID is compatible with any user-defined MS/MS database and provides automated searching for some of the largest MS/MS databases currently available. DecoID provides acquisition-independent, database-assisted deconvolution of metabolomic MS/MS spectra for improved metabolite identification.

DIAMetAlyzer	Pre-processing			The extraction of meaningful biological knowledge from high-throughput mass spectrometry data relies on limiting false discoveries to a manageable amount. For targeted approaches in metabolomics a main challenge is the detection of false positive metabolic features in the low signal-to-noise ranges of data-independent acquisition results and their filtering. Another factor is that the creation of assay libraries for data-independent acquisition analysis and the processing of extracted ion chromatograms have not been automated in metabolomics. Here we present a fully automated open-source workflow for high-throughput metabolomics that combines data-dependent and data-independent acquisition for library generation, analysis, and statistical validation, with rigorous control of the false-discovery rate while matching manual analysis regarding quantification accuracy. Using an experimentally specific data-dependent acquisition library based on reference substances allows for accurate identification of compounds and markers from data-independent acquisition data in low concentrations, facilitating biomarker quantification.

DNMS2Purifier	Pre-processing			The purity of tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is essential to MS/MS-based metabolite annotation and unknown exploration. This work presents a de novo approach to cleaning chimeric MS/MS spectra generated in liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)-based metabolomics. The assumption is that true fragments and their precursors are well correlated across the samples in a study, while false or contamination fragments are rather independent. Using data simulation, this work starts with an investigation of the negative effects of chimeric MS/MS spectra on spectral similarity analysis and molecular networking. Next, the characteristics of true and false fragments in chimeric MS/MS spectra were investigated using MS/MS of chemical standards. We recognized three fragment peak attributes indicative of whether a peak is a false fragment, including (1) intensity ratio fluctuation, (2) appearance rate, and (3) relative intensity. Using these attributes, we tested three machine learning models and identified XGBoost as the best model to achieve an area under the precision–recall curve of 0.98 for a clear separation between true and false fragments. Based on the trained model, we constructed an automated bioinformatic platform, DNMS2Purifier (short for de novo MS2Purifier), for metabolic features from metabolomics studies. DNMS2Purifier recognizes and processes chimeric MS/MS spectra without additional sample analysis or library confirmation. DNMS2Purifer was evaluated on a metabolomics data set generated with different MS/MS precursor isolation windows. It successfully captured the increase in the number of false fragments from the increased isolation window. DNMS2Purifier was also compared to MS2Purifier, an existing MS/MS spectral cleaning tool based on the addition of data-independent acquisition (DIA) analysis. Results indicated that DNMS2Purifier uniquely recognizes false fragments, which complements the previous DIA-based approach. Finally, DNMS2Purifier was demonstrated using a real experimental metabolomics study, showing improved MS/MS spectral quality and leading to an improved spectral match ratio and molecular networking outcome.

DuReS	Pre-processing			Mass spectrometry-based untargeted metabolomics is a powerful technique for profiling small molecules in biological samples, yet accurate metabolite identification remains challenging. The presence of random noise peaks in tandem mass spectra can lead to false annotations and necessitate time-consuming manual verification. A common method for removing noise from mass spectra is intensity thresholding, where low-intensity peaks are discarded by applying a user-defined cutoff. However, determining an optimal threshold is often data set-specific and may still retain many noisy peaks. We hypothesize that true signal peaks consistently recur across replicate tandem spectra generated from the same precursor ion, unlike random noise. Here, we present a freely available R package, Denoising Using Replicate Spectra (DuReS) (https://github.com/BiosystemEngineeringLab-IITB/dures), which accepts mzML files and feature lists and returns high-quality annotations and denoised mzML files, enabling users to integrate the denoising pipeline into their workflow seamlessly. This package is designed for data-dependent acquisition mode (DDA) data. It has (i) the main denoising module and (i) an optional tuning module to determine each data set’s optimal recurrence frequency cutoff (Fthreshold), considering variations in the intrinsic noise characteristics. We tested the tool on eight representative data sets selected from those available in metabolomics repositories. Our approach minimizes signal loss while maximizing noise reduction, effectively preserving diagnostically significant low-intensity fragments that would otherwise be lost through conventional intensity thresholding. This improves spectral matching metrics, leading to more accurate annotations and fewer false positives.

Eclipse	Pre-processing			Nontargeted LC-MS (liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry) metabolomics datasets contain a wealth of information but present many challenges during analysis and processing. Often, two or more independently processed datasets must be aligned to form a complete dataset, but existing software does not fully meet our needs. For this, we have created an open-source Python package called Eclipse. Eclipse uses a novel graph-based approach to handle complex matching scenarios that arise from n > 2 datasets.

Finnee 2024	Pre-processing			Metabolite identification and quantification in biological samples are crucial for understanding biochemical processes, disease mechanisms, and biomarker discovery. While targeted metabolomics focuses on specific compounds, untargeted metabolomics comprehensively assesses the entire metabolome. Liquid chromatography hyphenated with high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) has become a powerful tool for untargeted metabolomics due to its ability to detect various chemicals. LC-HRMS combines liquid chromatography's separation capabilities with mass spectrometry's high-resolution mass analysis. MS1 spectra, acquired in LC-HRMS, provide detailed mass-to-charge ratio information for detected ions, enabling simultaneous profiling of metabolites without prior knowledge of their structures or retention times. Pre-processing steps and feature detection algorithms are applied to raw MS1 spectra, facilitating downstream analysis, including statistical analysis, metabolite annotation, and pathway mapping. The choice between profile and centroid scans for MS1 data acquisition entails trade-offs in resolution, data complexity, and processing requirements. Several software tools have been developed to handle LC-HRMS data, providing functionalities for pre-processing, peak detection, metabolite identification, and statistical analysis. This article presents Finnee2024, a Matlab toolbox for analysing profile scan-based MS1 data. The toolbox allows good coverage, low false positives, and improved visualisation and control of extracted features. It offers enhancements over previous versions, facilitating faster calculations and leveraging the advantages of profile scans. The article highlights the changes in Finnee2024 using datasets from a comparative study of software packages, demonstrating its performance and usability.

G-Aligner	Pre-processing			Abstract  Background Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry is widely used in untargeted metabolomics for composition profiling. In multi-run analysis scenarios, features of each run are aligned into consensus features by feature alignment algorithms to observe the intensity variations across runs. However, most of the existing feature alignment methods focus more on accurate retention time correction, while underestimating the importance of feature matching. None of the existing methods can comprehensively consider feature correspondences among all runs and achieve optimal matching.      Results   To comprehensively analyze feature correspondences among runs, we propose G-Aligner, a graph-based feature alignment method for untargeted LC–MS data. In the feature matching stage, G-Aligner treats features and potential correspondences as nodes and edges in a multipartite graph, considers the multi-run feature matching problem an unbalanced multidimensional assignment problem, and provides three combinatorial optimization algorithms to find optimal matching solutions. In comparison with the feature alignment methods in OpenMS, MZmine2 and XCMS on three public metabolomics benchmark datasets, G-Aligner achieved the best feature alignment performance on all the three datasets with up to 9.8% and 26.6% increase in accurately aligned features and analytes, and helped all comparison software obtain more accurate results on their self-extracted features by integrating G-Aligner to their analysis workflow. G-Aligner is open-source and freely available at https://github.com/CSi-Studio/G-Aligner under a permissive license. Benchmark datasets, manual annotation results, evaluation methods and results are available at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.8313034      Conclusions   In this study, we proposed G-Aligner to improve feature matching accuracy for untargeted metabolomics LC–MS data. G-Aligner comprehensively considered potential feature correspondences between all runs, converting the feature matching problem as a multidimensional assignment problem (MAP). In evaluations on three public metabolomics benchmark datasets, G-Aligner achieved the highest alignment accuracy on manual annotated and popular software extracted features, proving the effectiveness and robustness of the algorithm.

HeuSMA	Pre-processing			Metabolomics, which involves the comprehensive analysis of small molecules within biological systems, plays a crucial role in elucidating the biochemical underpinnings of physiological processes and disease conditions. However, current coverage of the metabolome remains limited. In this study, we present a heuristic strategy for untargeted metabolomics analysis (HeuSMA) based on multiple chromatographic gradients to enhance the metabolome coverage in untargeted metabolomics. This strategy involves performing LC-MS analysis under multiple gradient conditions on a given sample (e.g., a pooled sample or a quality control sample) to obtain a comprehensive metabolomics data set, followed by constructing a heuristic peak list using a retention index system. Guided by this list, heuristic peak picking in quantitative metabolomics data is achieved. The benchmarking and validation results demonstrate that HeuSMA outperforms existing tools (such as MS-DIAL and MZmine) in terms of metabolite coverage and peak identification accuracy. Additionally, HeuSMA improves the accessibility of MS/MS data, thereby facilitating the metabolite annotation. The effectiveness of the HeuSMA strategy was further demonstrated through its application in serum metabolomics analysis of human hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). To facilitate the adoption of the HeuSMA strategy, we also developed two user-friendly graphical interface software solutions (HPLG and HP), which automate the analysis process, enabling researchers to efficiently manage data and derive meaningful conclusions (https://github.com/Lacterd/HeuSMA).

ImpLiMet	Pre-processing			Motivation Missing values are prevalent in high-throughput measurements due to various experimental or analytical reasons. Imputation, the process of replacing missing values in a dataset with estimated values, plays an important role in multivariate and machine learning analyses. The three missingness patterns, including missing completely at random, missing at random, and missing not at random, describe unique dependencies between the missing and observed data. The optimal imputation method for each dataset depends on the type of data, the cause of the missingness, and the nature of relationships between the missing and observed data. The challenge is to identify the optimal imputation solution for a given dataset. Results  ImpLiMet: is a user-friendly web-platform that enables users to impute missing data using eight different methods. For a given dataset, ImpLiMet suggests the optimal imputation solution through a grid search-based investigation of the error rate for imputation across three missingness data simulations. The effect of imputation can be visually assessed by histogram, kurtosis, and skewness, as well as principal component analysis comparing the impact of the chosen imputation method on the distribution and overall behavior of the data.

JPA	Pre-processing			 Extracting metabolic features from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data has been a long-standing bioinformatic challenge in untargeted metabolomics. Conventional feature extraction algorithms fail to recognize features with low signal intensities, poor chromatographic peak shapes, or those that do not fit the parameter settings. This problem also poses a challenge for MS-based exposome studies, as low-abundant metabolic or exposomic features cannot be automatically recognized from raw data. To address this data processing challenge, we developed an R package, JPA (short for Joint Metabolomic Data Processing and Annotation), to comprehensively extract metabolic features from raw LC-MS data. JPA performs feature extraction by combining a conventional peak picking algorithm and strategies for (1) recognizing features with bad peak shapes but that have tandem mass spectra (MS2) and (2) picking up features from a user-defined targeted list. The performance of JPA in global metabolomics was demonstrated using serial diluted urine samples, in which JPA was able to rescue an average of 25% of metabolic features that were missed by the conventional peak picking algorithm due to dilution. More importantly, the chromatographic peak shapes, analytical accuracy, and precision of the rescued metabolic features were all evaluated. Furthermore, owing to its sensitive feature extraction, JPA was able to achieve a limit of detection (LOD) that was up to thousands of folds lower when automatically processing metabolomics data of a serial diluted metabolite standard mixture analyzed in HILIC(−) and RP(+) modes. Finally, the performance of JPA in exposome research was validated using a mixture of 250 drugs and 255 pesticides at environmentally relevant levels. JPA detected an average of 2.3-fold more exposure compounds than conventional peak picking only.

LAGF	Pre-processing			Feature detection is a crucial step in the data preprocessing workflow of liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS). However, many existing methods are hindered by intricate parameter adjustments and high false positive rates during extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) construction and peak detection, which challenges the identification of spurious and missing compounds. This study introduces a novel algorithm, local asymmetric Gaussian fitting (LAGF), for peak detection. LAGF integrates with the “data points bins” EIC extraction algorithm to enhance the feature detection efficiency. By using a 1 Da data points bin for EIC extraction, computational time is significantly reduced, making the method well-suited for batch metabolomics analysis. LAGF minimizes parameter numbers of generalized two-sided asymmetric Gaussian fitting by automatically determining the peak center (μ) and height (α) while accommodating two-sided standard deviations (σ1 and σ2) to self-adaptively model peak patterns. Features are filtered based on a goodness-of-fit threshold of 0.5. The performance of LAGF was validated using standard mixtures and serum samples at different concentrations in reversed-phase or hydrophilic interaction LC mode. In most cases, LAGF outperformed conventional tools in terms of determination coefficient (R2) and relative standard deviation for automatically detected peak areas. The LAGF algorithm is available as open-source Python code alongside an interactive interface, facilitating implementation in both nontargeted and targeted LC–MS analysis to enhance peak detection and compound identification.

LongitudinalProf-MSMS-Method	Pre-processing			 Metabolite identification in untargeted metabolomics via tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) spectral matching is commonly performed by comparing experimental and reference MS/MS spectra acquired at one or a few collision energies, which generates a similarity score based on the relative intensities of fragment ions within each spectrum, referred to as cross-sectional profiling. Here, we introduced a novel method that significantly improved identification accuracy by comparing longitudinal fragment profiles, which consisted of the intensities of individual MS/MS fragments across multiple collision energies. This approach, termed longitudinal profiling, highlighted low-abundance fragments that were often overlooked by conventional cross-sectional methods, emphasizing predominant ions. We optimized the Jaccard similarity algorithm for longitudinal profiling and established identification criteria using an in-house spectral database comprising approximately 1,80,000 MS/MS spectra. The robustness of the method was validated using inter-instrument datasets, spiked standards, and human plasma samples. Compared with cross-sectional profiling using the optimal entropy algorithm, the longitudinal profiling method improved annotation accuracy by 8.7–25.9% and reduced the false discovery rate by 28.6–41.7%, resulting in a fair increase in the number of confidently annotated metabolites. This method enhances the probability of discovering true diagnostic markers while reducing the likelihood of false diagnostic markers. Our results demonstrate that longitudinal profiling provides a promising new avenue for more accurate metabolite identification in untargeted metabolomics.

MassLite	Pre-processing			Mass spectrometry (MS) has been one of the most widely used tools for bioanalytical analysis due to its high sensitivity, capability of quantitative analysis, and compatibility with biomolecules. Among various MS techniques, single cell mass spectrometry (SCMS) is an advanced approach to molecular analysis of cellular contents in individual cells. In tandem with the creation of novel experimental techniques, the development of new SCMS data analysis tools is equally important. As most published software packages are not specifically designed for pretreatment of SCMS data, including peak alignment and background removal, their applicability on processing SCMS data is generally limited. Hereby we introduce a Python platform, MassLite, specifically designed for rapid SCMS metabolomics data pretreatment. This platform is made user-friendly with graphical user interface (GUI) and exports data in the forms of each individual cell for further analysis. A core function of this tool is to use a novel peak alignment method that avoids the intrinsic drawbacks of traditional binning method, allowing for more effective handling of MS data obtained from high resolution mass spectrometers. Other functions, such as void scan filtering, dynamic grouping, and advanced background removal, are also implemented in this tool to improve pretreatment efficiency.

MESSES	Pre-processing			In recent years, the FAIR guiding principles and the broader concept of open science has grown in importance in academic research, especially as funding entities have aggressively promoted public sharing of research products. Key to public research sharing is deposition of datasets into online data repositories; but it can be a chore to transform messy unstructured data into the forms required by these repositories. To help generate Metabolomics Workbench depositions, we have developed the MESSES software package, implemented in the Python 3 programming language, and supported on Linux, Windows, and Mac operating systems. MESSES helps transform tabular data from multiple sources into a Metabolomics Workbench specific deposition format. The package provides three commands, extract, validate, and convert, that implement a natural data transformation workflow. Moreover, MESSES facilitates richer metadata capture than is typically attempted by manual efforts. The source code and extensive documentation is hosted on GitHub (https://github.com/MoseleyBioinformaticsLab/MESSES) and is also available on the Python Package Index (https://pypi.org/project/messes) for easy installation.

metabCombiner	Pre-processing			LC-HRMS experiments detect thousands of compounds, with only a small fraction of them identified in most studies. Traditional data processing pipelines contain an alignment step to assemble the measurements of overlapping features across samples into a unified table. However, data sets acquired under nonidentical conditions are not amenable to this process, mostly due to significant alterations in chromatographic retention times. Alignment of features between disparately acquired LC-MS metabolomics data could aid collaborative compound identification efforts and enable meta-analyses of expanded data sets. Here, we describe metabCombiner, a new computational pipeline for matching known and unknown features in a pair of untargeted LC-MS data sets and concatenating their abundances into a combined table of intersecting feature measurements. metabCombiner groups features by mass-to-charge (m/z) values to generate a search space of possible feature pair alignments, fits a spline through a set of selected retention time ordered pairs, and ranks alignments by m/z, mapped retention time, and relative abundance similarity. We evaluated this workflow on a pair of plasma metabolomics data sets acquired with different gradient elution methods, achieving a mean absolute retention time prediction error of roughly 0.06 min and a weighted per-compound matching accuracy of approximately 90%. We further demonstrate the utility of this method by comprehensively mapping features in urine and muscle metabolomics data sets acquired from different laboratories. metabCombiner has the potential to bridge the gap between otherwise incompatible metabolomics data sets and is available as an R package at https://github.com/hhabra/metabCombiner and Bioconductor.	metabCombiner: Paired Untargeted LC-HRMS Metabolomics Feature Matching and Concatenation of Disparately Acquired Data Sets	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.0c03693 	Analytical Chemistry	Habra, Hani, Kachman, Maureen, Bullock, Kevin, Clish, Clary, Evans, Charles R., & Karnovsky, Alla (2021). <i>metabCombiner</i>: Paired Untargeted LC-HRMS Metabolomics Feature Matching and Concatenation of Disparately Acquired Data Sets.

metabCombiner 2.0	Pre-processing			Liquid chromatography–high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS), as applied to untargeted metabolomics, enables the simultaneous detection of thousands of small molecules, generating complex datasets. Alignment is a crucial step in data processing pipelines, whereby LC-MS features derived from common ions are assembled into a unified matrix amenable to further analysis. Variability in the analytical factors that influence liquid chromatography separations complicates data alignment. This is prominent when aligning data acquired in different laboratories, generated using non-identical instruments, or between batches from large-scale studies. Previously, we developed metabCombiner for aligning disparately acquired LC-MS metabolomics datasets. Here, we report significant upgrades to metabCombiner that enable the stepwise alignment of multiple untargeted LC-MS metabolomics datasets, facilitating inter-laboratory reproducibility studies. To accomplish this, a “primary” feature list is used as a template for matching compounds in “target” feature lists. We demonstrate this workflow by aligning four lipidomics datasets from core laboratories generated using each institution’s in-house LC-MS instrumentation and methods. We also introduce batchCombine, an application of the metabCombiner framework for aligning experiments composed of multiple batches. metabCombiner is available as an R package on Github and Bioconductor, along with a new online version implemented as an R Shiny App.	metabCombiner 2.0: Disparate Multi-Dataset Feature Alignment for LC-MS Metabolomics 	https://www.mdpi.com/2218-1989/14/2/125	Metabolites	Habra, H., Meijer, J.

Metabonaut	Pre-processing			High-quality data preprocessing is essential for untargeted metabolomics experiments, where increasing dataset scale and complexity demand adaptable, robust, and reproducible software solutions. Modern preprocessing tools must evolve to integrate seamlessly with downstream analysis platforms, ensuring efficient and streamlined workflows.

Developed through an open-source, community-driven approach, xcms has maintained long-term stability while continuously expanding its capabilities and accessibility. We present recent advancements that position xcms as a central component of a modular and interoperable software ecosystem for metabolomics data analysis. Key improvements include enhanced scalability, enabling the processing of large-scale experiments with thousands of samples on standard computing hardware. These developments empower users to build comprehensive, customizable, and reproducible workflows tailored to diverse experimental designs and analytical needs. An expanding collection of tutorials, documentation, and teaching materials further supports both new and experienced users in leveraging the broader R and Bioconductor ecosystems. These resources facilitate the integration of statistical modeling, visualization tools, and domain-specific packages, extending the reach and impact of xcms workflows.

Metaboprep	Pre-processing			Motivation Metabolomics is an increasingly common part of health research and there is need for preanalytical data processing. Researchers typically need to characterize the data and to exclude errors within the context of the intended analysis. Whilst some preprocessing steps are common, there is currently a lack of standardization and reporting transparency for these procedures. Results  Here, we introduce metaboprep, a standardized data processing workflow to extract and characterize high quality metabolomics datasets. The package extracts data from preformed worksheets, provides summary statistics and enables the user to select samples and metabolites for their analysis based on a set of quality metrics. A report summarizing quality metrics and the influence of available batch variables on the data are generated for the purpose of open disclosure.

Metanorm	Pre-processing			Metabolomics studies employing liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry are affected by signal drift and batch effects, introducing technical variance that impedes biological knowledge discovery. Quality control (QC) sample-based normalization strategies are widely implemented but remain vulnerable to outliers, thereby reducing normalization performance. We introduce rLOESS, rGAM and tGAM, three robust normalization methods that improve resistance to outliers by downweighting or accommodating them. Leveraging additive models, the rGAM and tGAM methods allow flexible non-linear modeling, differential sample weighting, and data-driven QC representativeness evaluation. Implementations of these methods are gathered in the Metanorm R package, integrating robust normalization with visualization for performance verification, while supporting efficient parallel processing. Spanning in silico and experimental datasets, the robust methods, relative to existing strategies, consistently demonstrated a reduction in false positive and false negative differentially abundant metabolites, improved replicate concordance, and reduced batch effects. Metanorm is versatile, supporting normalization in metabolomics studies across scales and experimental setups.

MOCCA	Pre-processing			Reaction screening and high-throughput experimentation (HTE) coupled with liquid chromatography (HPLC and UHPLC) are becoming more important than ever in synthetic chemistry. With a growing number of experiments, it is increasingly difficult to ensure correct peak identification and integration, especially due to unknown side components which often overlap with the peaks of interest. We developed an improved version of the MOCCA Python package with a web-based graphical user interface (GUI) for automated processing of chromatograms, including baseline correction, intelligent peak picking, peak purity checks, deconvolution of overlapping peaks, and compound tracking. The individual automatic processing steps have been improved compared to the previous version of MOCCA to make the software more dependable and versatile. The algorithm accuracy was benchmarked using three datasets and compared to the previous MOCCA implementation and published results. The processing is fully automated with the possibility to include calibration and internal standards. The software supports chromatograms with photo-diode array detector (DAD) data from most commercial HPLC systems, and the Python package and GUI implementation are open-source to allow addition of new features and further development.

MPACT	Pre-processing			Untargeted metabolomics is a powerful tool for investigating chemistry of complex biological systems, but its utility is compromised by the presence of uninformative features and the limited efficiency of currently available prioritization tools. More effective filtering and prioritization tools are required to address the challenges of large untargeted metabolomics datasets. Here, we introduce Metabolomics Peak Analysis Computational Tool (MPACT), a new mass spectrometry data analysis platform employing filtering based on multiple modalities, statistical techniques incorporating multilevel replication, and interactive data visualization. We demonstrate application of MPACT to uncover hidden effects of the rare earth element cerium on tunicate-associated bacterium Streptomyces sp. PTY087I2, culminating in characterization of two thiolated compounds including a new cysteine derivative, granaticin C, and granaticin D, recently described as mycothiogranaticin A. While we demonstrate application of MPACT to microbial natural products discovery using an elicitation approach, the platform should be readily adaptable to investigation of multipartite interactions, biomarker detection, small molecules in the environment, and a wide range of other complex sample types.

MS-IDF	Pre-processing			Chemical isotope labeling liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is an emerging metabolomic strategy for the quantification and characterization of small molecular compounds in biological samples. However, its subsequent data analysis is not straightforward due to a large amount of data produced and interference of biological matrices. In order to improve the efficiency of searching and identification of target endogenous metabolites, a new software tool for nontargeted metabolomics data processing called MS-IDF was developed based on the principle of a narrow mass defect filter. The developed tool provided two function modules, including IsoFinder and MDFinder. The IsoFinder function module applied a conventional peak extraction method by using a fixed mass differences between the heavy and light labels and by the alignment of chromatographic retention time (RT). On the other hand, MDFinder was designed to incorporate the accurate mass defect differences between or among stable isotopes in the peak extraction process. By setting an appropriate filter interval, the target metabolites can be efficiently screened out while eliminating interference. Notably, the present results showed that the efficiency in compound identification using the new MDFinder module was nearly doubled as compared to the conventional IsoFinder method (an increase from 259 to 423 compounds). The Matlab codes of the developed MS-IDF software are available from github at https://github.com/jydong2018/MS_IDF. Based on the MS-IDF software tool, a novel and effective approach from nontargeted to targeted metabolomics research was developed and applied to the exploration of potential primary amine biomarkers in patients with schizophrenia. With this approach, potential biomarkers, including N,N-dimethylglycine, S-adenosine-l-methionine, dl-homocysteine, and spermidine, were discovered.

MS-TDF Software 	Pre-processing			Chemical derivatization is a widely employed strategy in metabolomics to enhance metabolite coverage by improving chromatographic behavior and increasing the ionization rates in mass spectroscopy (MS). However, derivatization might complicate MS data, posing challenges for data mining due to the lack of a corresponding benchmark database. To address this issue, we developed a triple-dimensional combinatorial derivatization strategy for nontargeted metabolomics. This strategy utilizes three structurally similar derivatization reagents and is supported by MS-TDF software for accelerated data processing. Notably, simultaneous derivatization of specific metabolite functional groups in biological samples produced compounds with stable but distinct chromatographic retention times and mass numbers, facilitating discrimination by MS-TDF, an in-house MS data processing software. In this study, carbonyl analogues in human plasma were derivatized using a combination of three hydrazide-based derivatization reagents: 2-hydrazinopyridine, 2-hydrazino-5-methylpyridine, and 2-hydrazino-5-cyanopyridine (6-hydrazinonicotinonitrile). This approach was applied to identify potential carbonyl biomarkers in lung cancer. Analysis and validation of human plasma samples demonstrated that our strategy improved the recognition accuracy of metabolites and reduced the risk of false positives, providing a useful method for nontargeted metabolomics studies. The MATLAB code for MS-TDF is available on GitHub at https://github.com/CaixiaYuan/MS-TDF.

MS1FA	Pre-processing			Motivation Untargeted metabolomics, the comprehensive analysis of small molecules in biological systems, has become an invaluable tool for understanding physiology and metabolism. However, the annotation of metabolomic data is often confounded by the presence of redundant features, which can arise from e.g. multimerization, in-source fragments (ISFs), and adducts. Results MS1FA uniquely integrates all major annotation approaches for redundant features within a single interactive platform. It combines correlation-based grouping with reliable ISF annotation using MS2 data and operates with MS1 data only, MS2 data only, or both. Additionally, it offers a distinctive method for grouping features based on relational criteria. As the only web-based platform with these capabilities, MS1FA provides easy access and allows users to explore and annotate the feature table interactively, with options to download the results. Availability and implementation MS1FA is freely accessible at https://ms1fa.helmholtz-hzi.de.

MS2Planner	Pre-processing			Motivation Untargeted mass spectrometry experiments enable the profiling of metabolites in complex biological samples. The collected fragmentation spectra are the metabolite’s fingerprints that are used for molecule identification and discovery. Two main mass spectrometry strategies exist for the collection of fragmentation spectra: data-dependent acquisition (DDA) and data-independent acquisition (DIA). In the DIA strategy, all the metabolites ions in predefined mass-to-charge ratio ranges are co-isolated and co-fragmented, resulting in multiplexed fragmentation spectra that are challenging to annotate. In contrast, in the DDA strategy, fragmentation spectra are dynamically and specifically collected for the most abundant ions observed, causing redundancy and sub-optimal fragmentation spectra collection. Yet, DDA results in less multiplexed fragmentation spectra that can be readily annotated. Results We introduce the MS2Planner workflow, an Iterative Optimized Data Acquisition strategy that optimizes the number of high-quality fragmentation spectra over multiple experimental acquisitions using topological sorting. Our results showed that MS2Planner increases the annotation rate by 38.6% and is 62.5% more sensitive and 9.4% more specific compared to DDA. Availability and implementation MS2Planner code is available at https://github.com/mohimanilab/MS2Planner. The generation of the inclusion list from MS2Planner was performed with python scripts available at https://github.com/lfnothias/IODA_MS.

msFeaST	Pre-processing			Computational metabolomics workflows have revolutionized the untargeted metabolomics field. However, the organization and prioritization of metabolite features remains a laborious process. Organizing metabolomics data is often done through mass fragmentation-based spectral similarity grouping, resulting in feature sets that also represent an intuitive and scientifically meaningful first stage of analysis in untargeted metabolomics. Exploiting such feature sets, feature-set testing has emerged as an approach that is widely used in genomics and targeted metabolomics pathway enrichment analyses. It allows for formally combining groupings with statistical testing into more meaningful pathway enrichment conclusions. Here, we present msFeaST (mass spectral Feature Set Testing), a feature-set testing and visualization workflow for LC-MS/MS untargeted metabolomics data. Feature-set testing involves statistically assessing differential abundance patterns for groups of features across experimental conditions. We developed msFeaST to make use of spectral similarity-based feature groupings generated using k-medoids clustering, where the resulting clusters serve as a proxy for grouping structurally similar features with potential biosynthesis pathway relationships. Spectral clustering done in this way allows for feature group-wise statistical testing using the globaltest package, which provides high power to detect small concordant effects via joint modeling and reduced multiplicity adjustment penalties. Hence, msFeaST provides interactive integration of the semi-quantitative experimental information with mass-spectral structural similarity information, enhancing the prioritization of features and feature sets during exploratory data analysis. Availability and implementation  The msFeaST workflow is freely available through https://github.com/kevinmildau/msFeaST and built to work on MacOS and Linux systems.

MultiABLER	Pre-processing			Mass spectrometry (MS)-based untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic approaches are being used increasingly in biomedical research. The adoption and integration of these data are critical to the overall multi-omic toolkit. Recently, a sample extraction method called Multi-ABLE has been developed, which enables concurrent generation of proteomic and untargeted metabolomic and lipidomic data from a small amount of tissue. The proteomics field has a well-established set of software for processing of acquired data; however, there is a lack of a unified, off-the-shelf, ready-to-use bioinformatics pipeline that can take advantage of and prepare concurrently generated metabolomic and lipidomic data for joint downstream analyses. Here we present an R pipeline called MultiABLER as a unified and simple upstream processing and analysis pipeline for both metabolomics and lipidomics datasets acquired using liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.

mzLearn	Pre-processing			Metabolite alterations are linked to diseases, yet large-scale untargeted metabolomics remains constrained by challenges in signal detection and integration of diverse datasets for developing pre-trained generative models. Here, we introduce mzLearn, a data-driven MS1 signal-detection and alignment method that runs from mzML files without user-set parameters. Across 15 public datasets, mzLearn detects 11,442 signals on average vs 7,100 (XCMS) and 4,655 (ASARI), with higher TP (89.0% vs 77.4% vs 49.6%) and lower FP (12.5% vs 17.3% vs 18.8%), while correcting instrument drifts across large cohorts without experimental QC samples. mzLearn detected 2,736 robust metabolite signals from 22 public studies (20,548 blood samples), enabling the development of pre-trained variational autoencoder for untargeted metabolomics. Learned metabolite representations reflected demographic data and when fine-tuned on unseen renal cell carcinoma data, improved risk stratification and overall survival predictions, while feature-importance analysis (SHAP) highlighted biologically plausible lipid and carnitine signals. By producing a consistent, high-quality MS1 feature matrix at scale, mzLearn paves the way for developing pre-trained foundation models for untargeted metabolomics.	mzLearn, a data-driven LC/MS signal detection algorithm, enables pre-trained generative models for enhanced patient stratification	https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.01.26.634927v3	bioRxiv	Pirhaji, L., Eaton, J., Jeewajee, A.

NA	Pre-processing			Untargeted metabolomics is a powerful tool for measuring and understanding complex biological chemistries. However, employment, bioinformatics and downstream analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) data can be daunting for inexperienced users. Numerous open-source and free-to-use data processing and analysis tools exist for various untargeted MS approaches, including liquid chromatography (LC), but choosing the 'correct' pipeline isn't straight-forward. This tutorial, in conjunction with a user-friendly online guide presents a workflow for connecting these tools to process, analyse and annotate various untargeted MS datasets. The workflow is intended to guide exploratory analysis in order to inform decision-making regarding costly and time-consuming downstream targeted MS approaches. We provide practical advice concerning experimental design, organisation of data and downstream analysis, and offer details on sharing and storing valuable MS data for posterity. The workflow is editable and modular, allowing flexibility for updated/changing methodologies and increased clarity and detail as user participation becomes more common. Hence, the authors welcome contributions and improvements to the workflow via the online repository. We believe that this workflow will streamline and condense complex mass-spectrometry approaches into easier, more manageable, analyses thereby generating opportunities for researchers previously discouraged by inaccessible and overly complicated software.

NA	Pre-processing			Direct infusion mass spectrometry (DIMS) is growing in popularity as an effective method for the screening of biological samples in clinical metabolomics. Being quick to execute, DIMS generally requires special skills when interpreting the results of measurements. By inspecting the similarities between two-dimensional electrospray ionization with quadrupole time-of-flight (ESI-QTOF) and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization (MALDI) mass spectra, the pipeline for processing QTOF mass spectra using open-source packages (MALDIquant, MSnbase and MetaboAnalystR) was tested. Previously, all algorithmic workflows have relied on the application of software either provided by a vendor or privately developed by enthusiasts. Here, we computationally examined two ways of interpreting the DIMS results of human blood metabolomic profiling. The studied spectra were acquired using ESI-QTOF maXis Impact II (Bruker Daltonics, Billerica, MA, USA), then pre-processed using COMPASS/DataAnalysis commercial software and mapped onto the metabolites using in-lab-developed MatLab scripts. Alternatively, in this work we used the open-source packages MALDIquant, for spectrum pre-processing, and MetaboAnalystR, for data interpretation, instead of the low-availability commercial and home-made tools. Using a set of 100 plasma samples (20 from volunteers with normal body mass index and 80 from patients at different stages of obesity), we observed a high degree of concordance in annotated metabolic pathways between the proprietary DataAnalysis/MatLab pipeline and our freely available solution.

NP-PRESS	Pre-processing			Natural products (NP) are pivotal in pharmaceutical development, but those compounds of low yield or hard-to-detect are always neglected easily. Mass spectrometry (MS) is a powerful tool for discovering NPs. However, MS signals of NPs are often hidden in numerous interfering features including those from both abiotic and biotic processes. Currently, there is no effective method to differentiate between signals from NPs and interfering features caused by biotic processed, such as microbial processed cellular degradation products and media components. Here, we introduce NP-PRESS strategy, which prioritizes new NPs with the aid of two newly developed MS1 and MS2 data analysis algorithms, FUNEL and simRank. NP-PRESS excels in highlighting NPs by thoroughly removal of overwhelming irrelevant features, particularly those from biotic processes. As a proof-of-concept, NP-PRESS was applied to Streptomyces albus J1074 and guided the discovery of new surugamide analogs and further demonstrated its performance on an unusual anaerobic bacterium Wukongibacter baidiensis M2B1, leading to the discovery of a new family of depsipeptides baidienmycins, exhibiting potent antimicrobial and anticancer activities. These successes underscore the efficacy of NP-PRESS in uncovering novel natural products from diverse bacteria, especially for those extremophiles and unveiling of hardly detectable metabolites.

OpenNAU	Pre-processing			Objective  As an important part of metabolomics analysis, untargeted metabolomics has become a powerful tool in the study of tumor mechanisms and the discovery of metabolic markers with high-throughput spectrometric data which also poses great challenges to data analysis, from the extraction of raw data to the identification of differential metabolites. To date, a large number of analytical tools and processes have been developed and constructed to serve untargeted metabolomics research. The different selection of analytical tools and parameter settings lead to varied results of untargeted metabolomics data. Our goal is to establish an easily operated platform and obtain a repeatable analysis result. Methods  We used the R language basic environment to construct the preprocessing system of the original data and the LAMP (Linux+Apache+MySQL+PHP) architecture to build a cloud mass spectrum data analysis system. Results  An open-source analysis software for untargeted metabolomics data (openNAU) was constructed. It includes the extraction of raw mass data and quality control for the identification of differential metabolic ion peaks. A reference metabolomics database based on public databases was also constructed. Conclusions  A complete analysis system platform for untargeted metabolomics was established. This platform provides a complete template interface for the addition and updating of the analysis process, so we can finish complex analyses of untargeted metabolomics with simple human-computer interactions.

Peak Pair Pruner	Pre-processing			Motivation Isotopic labeling is an essential relative quantification strategy in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics, ideal for studying large cohorts by minimizing common sources of variations in quantitation. MS-DIAL is a free and popular general metabolomics platform that has isotopic labeling data processing capabilities but lacks features provided by other software specialized for isotopic labeling data analysis, such as isotopic pair validation and tabular light-to-heavy peak ratio reporting. Results  We developed Peak Pair Pruner (PPP), a standalone Python program for post-processing of MS-DIAL alignment matrixes.

PeakPerformance	Pre-processing			A major bottleneck of chromatography-based analytics has been the elusive fully automated identification and integration of peak data without the need of extensive human supervision. The presented Python package PeakPerformance applies Bayesian inference to chromatographic peak fitting, and provides an automated approach featuring model selection and uncertainty quantification. Currently, its application is focused on data from targeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), but its design allows for an expansion to other chromatographic techniques. PeakPerformance is implemented in Python and the source code is available on GitHub. It is unit-tested on Linux and Windows and accompanied by general introductory documentation, as well as example notebooks.  Practical application The presented PeakPerformance tool performs automated chromatographic peak data fitting using Bayesian methodology. Accordingly, it innovates by delivering built-in uncertainty quantification for each peak, thus taking the measurement noise into account. Using a convergence statistic and based on the determined peak uncertainties, the differentiation of signals into peak and noise was improved and false positives or negatives were largely eliminated. The provided documentation and the implemented convenience functions are meant to lower the barrier of entry for users with little programming experience. Lastly, the modular design of the software enables modification and expansion to data from different chromatographic methods.

Pear Review	Pre-processing			Background Our laboratory analyses over 100,000 samples for multiple analytes yearly. Correctly annotating and quantifying analytes using targeted MS/MS analysis is crucial for most laboratories. Therefore, mass spectrometric instrument manufacturers include software capable of automatic chromatographic peak detection and integration, which is used for most routine applications. Although this generally works well, mistakes such as accidentally selecting a nearby matrix peak or drawing an incorrect baseline are relatively common. Especially when results are to be used for enforcement, a time-consuming manual review of each integrated peak is still required to obtain reliable results. This work aims to provide a tool that can significantly reduce the manual workload of reviewing peak integration, thereby reducing the time used for manual review while ensuring that errors made by automatic integration can be corrected by human experts. Results Peak Evaluation and Automated Review tool, or PEAR review, is a machine learning-type tool that can read automatic integrations from various brands of MS equipment and compare them with a set of examples stored in a database of correct peak integrations provided by analysts that are relevant for the type of analysis. Moreover, the automatic review process checks all available ion transitions for a target compound. With those ingredients, the tool can autonomously decide how a peak should be quantified or whether a human expert should review it. The developed tool was tested on routine data processed with a widely used vendor-specific software, and we found that 85% of all chromatograms were handled automatically by this tool. Only the remaining 15% needed a ‘conventional’ manual review. The qualitative and quantitative performance of the PEAR tool was found to be equivalent to that of expert human integration, underlining its reliability. Significance Our findings indicate that 85% of all manual integration checks can be skipped using PEAR. This reduces the often tedious workload of reviewing all peaks in multiple chromatograms while offering the same quality as full human intervention.

PFΔScreen	Pre-processing			Abstract Per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are a huge group of anthropogenic chemicals with unique properties that are used in countless products and applications. Due to the high stability of their C-F bonds, PFAS or their transformation products (TPs) are persistent in the environment, leading to ubiquitous detection in various samples worldwide. Since PFAS are industrial chemicals, the availability of authentic PFAS reference standards is limited, making non-target screening (NTS) approaches based on high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) necessary for a more comprehensive characterization. NTS usually is a time-consuming process, since only a small fraction of the detected chemicals can be identified. Therefore, efficient prioritization of relevant HRMS signals is one of the most crucial steps. We developed PFΔScreen, a Python-based open-source tool with a simple graphical user interface (GUI) to perform efficient feature prioritization using several PFAS-specific techniques such as the highly promising MD/C-m/C approach, Kendrick mass defect analysis, diagnostic fragments (MS2), fragment mass differences (MS2), and suspect screening. Feature detection from vendor-independent MS raw data (mzML, data-dependent acquisition) is performed via pyOpenMS (or custom feature lists) with subsequent calculations for prioritization and identification of PFAS in both HPLC- and GC-HRMS data. The PFΔScreen workflow is presented on four PFAS-contaminated agricultural soil samples from south-western Germany. Over 15 classes of PFAS (more than 80 single compounds with several isomers) could be identified, including four novel classes, potentially TPs of the precursors fluorotelomer mercapto alkyl phosphates (FTMAPs). PFΔScreen can be used within the Python environment and is easily automatically installable and executable on Windows. Its source code is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/JonZwe/PFAScreen).

RegFilter	Pre-processing			Untargeted metabolomics is often used in studies that aim to trace the metabolic profile in a broad context, with the data-dependent acquisition (DDA) mode being the most commonly used method. However, this approach has the limitation that not all detected ions are fragmented in the data acquisition process, in addition to the lack of specificity regarding the process of fragmentation of biological signals. The present work aims to extend the detection of biological signals and contribute to overcoming the fragmentation limits of the DDA mode with a dynamic procedure that combines experimental and in silico approaches. Metabolomic analysis was performed on three different species of actinomycetes using liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry. The data obtained were preprocessed by the MZmine software and processed by the custom package, RegFilter. RegFilter allowed the coverage of the entire chromatographic run and the selection of precursor ions for fragmentation that were previously missed in DDA mode. Most of the ions selected by the tool could be annotated through three levels of annotation, presenting biological relevant candidates. In addition, the tool offers the possibility of creating local spectral libraries curated according to the user’s interests. Thus, the adoption of a dynamic analysis flow using RegFilter allowed for detection optimization of biological signals, previously absent in the DDA mode. In addition, this workflow enables the creation and search of in-house tailored custom libraries.

rtmsEcho	Pre-processing			Mass spectrometry (MS) is a well-established technology in biological research, enabling sensitive and precise quantitative analysis of complex samples. While traditional LC-MS systems provide robust performance for targeted analyses, their reliance on chromatographic separation limits throughput, rendering large-scale studies inefficient. The emergence of acoustic ejection mass spectrometry (AEMS) has revolutionized high-throughput workflows by eliminating chromatography and enabling direct nanoliter-scale sampling, achieving hundreds to thousands of measurements per hour. However, AEMSs full potential remains constrained by software limitations--existing tools lack robust automated processing capabilities for critical tasks such as peak detection, integration, and multimodal data analysis (e.g., multiple reaction monitoring, precursor ion, and neutral loss scans). To address this gap, we developed rtmsEcho, an open-source R package that extends our previously published rtms framework. This specialized solution provides direct access to AEMS data, enabling customizable processing of both MRM and full-scan acquisitions (precursor ion and neutral loss modes) while automating shot-to-peak association and spectral analysis. By streamlining data extraction and quantification, rtmsEcho enhances efficiency and reproducibility in high-throughput applications, including drug discovery, quality control, and clinical diagnostics. This innovation bridges a critical gap in AEMS data analysis, allowing researchers to fully leverage the speed and precision of next-generation mass spectrometry.	rtmsEcho: An Open-Source R Package for Automated Analysis of Acoustic Ejection Mass Spectrometry Data	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c03730	Analytical Chemistry	Rimmer, M.A., Twarog, N., Ranathunge, T.A., Wang, J., Li, Y., Chen, T., ...

Spectral Denoising	Pre-processing			Chemical exposures may affect human metabolism and contribute to the etiology of neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease. Identifying these small metabolites involves matching experimental spectra to reference spectra in databases. However, environmental chemicals or physiologically active metabolites are usually present at low concentrations in human specimens. The presence of noise ions can substantially degrade spectral quality, leading to false negatives and reduced identification rates. In response to this challenge, the Spectral Denoising algorithm removes both chemical and electronic noise. Spectral Denoising outperformed alternative methods in benchmarking studies on 240 tested metabolites. It improved high confident compound identifications at an average 35-fold lower concentrations than previously achievable. Spectral Denoising proved highly robust against varying levels of both chemical and electronic noise even with a greater than 150-fold higher intensity of noise ions than true fragment ions. For human plasma samples from patients with Alzheimer’s disease that were analyzed on the Orbitrap Astral mass spectrometer, Denoising Search detected 2.5-fold more annotated compounds compared to the Exploris 240 Orbitrap instrument, including drug metabolites, household and industrial chemicals, and pesticides.

TopNEXt	Pre-processing			Motivation Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry experiments aim to produce high-quality fragmentation spectra, which can be used to annotate metabolites. However, current Data-Dependent Acquisition approaches may fail to collect spectra of sufficient quality and quantity for experimental outcomes, and extend poorly across multiple samples by failing to share information across samples or by requiring manual expert input. Results  We present TopNEXt, a real-time scan prioritization framework that improves data acquisition in multi-sample Liquid Chromatography Tandem Mass Spectrometry metabolomics experiments. TopNEXt extends traditional Data-Dependent Acquisition exclusion methods across multiple samples by using a Region of Interest and intensity-based scoring system. Through both simulated and lab experiments, we show that methods incorporating these novel concepts acquire fragmentation spectra for an additional 10% of our set of target peaks and with an additional 20% of acquisition intensity. By increasing the quality and quantity of fragmentation spectra, TopNEXt can help improve metabolite identification with a potential impact across a variety of experimental contexts. Availability and implementation  TopNEXt is implemented as part of the ViMMS framework and the latest version can be found at https://github.com/glasgowcompbio/vimms.

xcms	Pre-processing			High-quality data preprocessing is essential for untargeted metabolomics experiments, where increasing data set scale and complexity demand adaptable, robust, and reproducible software solutions. Modern preprocessing tools must evolve to integrate seamlessly with downstream analysis platforms, ensuring efficient and streamlined workflows. Since its introduction in 2005, the xcms R package has become one of the most widely used tools for LC-MS data preprocessing. Developed through an open-source, community-driven approach, xcms maintains long-term stability while continuously expanding its capabilities and accessibility. We present recent advancements that position xcms as a central component of a modular and interoperable software ecosystem for metabolomics data analysis. Key improvements include enhanced scalability, enabling the processing of large-scale experiments with thousands of samples on standard computing hardware. These developments empower users to build comprehensive, customizable, and reproducible workflows tailored to diverse experimental designs and analytical needs. An expanding collection of tutorials, documentation, and teaching materials further supports both new and experienced users in leveraging broader R and Bioconductor ecosystems. These resources facilitate the integration of statistical modeling, visualization tools, and domain-specific packages, extending the reach and impact of xcms workflows. Together, these enhancements solidify xcms as a cornerstone of modern metabolomics research.	xcms in Peak Form: Now Anchoring a Complete Metabolomics Data Preprocessing and Analysis Software Ecosystem	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.analchem.5c04338	Analytical Chemistry	Louail, P., Brunius, C., Garcia-Aloy, M., Kumler, W., Storz, N., Stanstrup, J., Treutler, H., Vangeenderhuysen, P., Witting, M., Neumann, S., & Rainer, J.

3D-MSNet	Pre-processing		Yes	Motivation Liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry is widely used in composition profiling in untargeted metabolomics research. While retaining complete sample information, mass spectrometry (MS) data naturally have the characteristics of high dimensionality, high complexity, and huge data volume. In mainstream quantification methods, none of the existing methods can perform direct 3D analysis on lossless profile MS signals. All software simplify calculations by dimensionality reduction or lossy grid transformation, ignoring the full 3D signal distribution of MS data and resulting in inaccurate feature detection and quantification. Results  On the basis that the neural network is effective for high-dimensional data analysis and can discover implicit features from large amounts of complex data, in this work, we propose 3D-MSNet, a novel deep learning-based model for untargeted feature extraction. 3D-MSNet performs direct feature detection on 3D MS point clouds as an instance segmentation task. After training on a self-annotated 3D feature dataset, we compared our model with nine popular software (MS-DIAL, MZmine 2, XCMS Online, MarkerView, Compound Discoverer, MaxQuant, Dinosaur, DeepIso, PointIso) on two metabolomics and one proteomics public benchmark datasets. Our 3D-MSNet model outperformed other software with significant improvement in feature detection and quantification accuracy on all evaluation datasets. Furthermore, 3D-MSNet has high feature extraction robustness and can be widely applied to profile MS data acquired with various high-resolution mass spectrometers with various resolutions.

DeepMSProfiler	Pre-processing		Yes	Untargeted metabolomic analysis using mass spectrometry provides comprehensive metabolic profiling, but its medical application faces challenges of complex data processing, high inter-batch variability, and unidentified metabolites. Here, we present DeepMSProfiler, an explainable deep-learning-based method, enabling end-to-end analysis on raw metabolic signals with output of high accuracy and reliability. Using cross-hospital 859 human serum samples from lung adenocarcinoma, benign lung nodules, and healthy individuals, DeepMSProfiler successfully differentiates the metabolomic profiles of different groups (AUC 0.99) and detects early-stage lung adenocarcinoma (accuracy 0.961). Model flow and ablation experiments demonstrate that DeepMSProfiler overcomes inter-hospital variability and effects of unknown metabolites signals. Our ensemble strategy removes background-category phenomena in multi-classification deep-learning models, and the novel interpretability enables direct access to disease-related metabolite-protein networks. Further applying to lipid metabolomic data unveils correlations of important metabolites and proteins. Overall, DeepMSProfiler offers a straightforward and reliable method for disease diagnosis and mechanism discovery, enhancing its broad applicability. Untargeted metabolomic analysis provides comprehensive metabolic profiling but faces challenges in medical application. Here, the authors present an explainable deep learning method for end-to-end analysis on raw metabolic signals to differentiate metabolomic profiles of cancers with high accuracy.

EVA	Pre-processing		Yes	Extracting metabolic features from liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) data relies on the recognition of extracted ion chromatogram (EIC) peak shapes using peak picking algorithms. Unfortunately, all peak picking algorithms present a significant drawback of generating a problematic number of false positives. In this work, we take advantage of deep learning technology to develop a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based program that can automatically recognize metabolic features with poor EIC shapes, which are of low feature fidelity and more likely to be false. Our CNN model was trained using 25095 EIC plots collected from 22 LC-MS-based metabolomics projects of various sample types, LC and MS conditions. Notably, we manually inspected all the EIC plots to assign good or poor EIC quality for accurate model training. The trained CNN model is embedded into a C#-based program, named EVA (short for evaluation). The EVA Windows Application is a versatile platform that can process metabolic features generated by LC-MS systems of various vendors and processed using various data processing software. Our comprehensive evaluation of EVA indicates that it achieves over 90% classification accuracy. EVA can be readily used in LC-MS-based metabolomics projects and is freely available on the Microsoft Store by searching “EVA Metabolomics”.

GCMSFormer	Pre-processing		Yes	Gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) is one of the most important instruments for analyzing volatile organic compounds. However, the complexity of real samples and the limitations of chromatographic separation capabilities lead to coeluting compounds without ideal separation. In this study, a Transformer-based automatic resolution method (GCMSFormer) is proposed to resolve mass spectra from GC–MS peaks in an end-to-end manner, predicting the mass spectra of components directly from the raw overlapping peaks data. Furthermore, orthogonal projection resolution (OPR) was integrated into GCMSFormer to resolve minor components. The GCMSFormer model was trained, validated, and tested using 100,000 augmented data. It achieves 99.88% of the bilingual evaluation understudy (BLEU) value on the test set, significantly higher than the 97.68% BLEU value of the baseline sequence-to-sequence model long short-term memory (LSTM). GCMSFormer was also compared with two nondeep learning resolution tools (MZmine and AMDIS) and two deep learning resolution tools (PARAFAC2 with DL and MSHub/GNPS) on a real plant essential oil GC–MS data set. Their resolution results were compared on evaluation metrics, including the number of compounds resolved, mass spectral match score, correlation coefficient, explained variance, and resolution speed. The results demonstrate that GCMSFormer has better resolution performance, higher automation, and faster resolution speed. In summary, GCMSFormer is an end-to-end, fast, fully automatic, and accurate method for analyzing GC–MS data of complex samples.

IsoFusion	Pre-processing		Yes	Mass spectrometry plays a crucial role in biomedicine by detecting isotopes, contributing significantly to research, diagnostics, and therapy development. This study introduces IsoFusion, a deep learning model designed to address isotope detection in raw mass spectra. Rather than directly applying convolutional layers to all signal and noise peaks, IsoFusion employs a trial-and-error strategy. First, it investigates all potential charge states (trials) and collects signal peaks around expected m/z values for each trial. Then, convolutional layers extract features from each trial, which are fused to identify the correct one. Finally, the reparameterization trick predicts isotope features based on this correct trial. A key advantage of IsoFusion is shared model parameters across all trials, enhancing feature learning for less common charge states using data from prevalent ones. Our results show a significant accuracy improvement for charge state 5, reaching 99.42%, compared to DeepIso's 43.36%. Moreover, IsoFusion achieves a 97.33% detection accuracy for isotopes, with 2.4% of detected isotopes previously unidentified by four commonly used methods.

MSMCE	Pre-processing		Yes	Mass spectrometry (MS) analysis plays a crucial role in the biomedical field; however, the high dimensionality and complexity of MS data pose significant challenges for feature extraction and classification. Deep learning has become a dominant approach in data analysis, and while some deep learning methods have achieved progress in MS classification, their feature representation capabilities remain limited. Most existing methods rely on single-channel representations, which struggle to effectively capture structural information within MS data. To address these limitations, we propose a Multi-Channel Embedding Representation Module (MSMCE), which focuses on modeling inter-channel dependencies to generate multi-channel representations of raw MS data. Additionally, we implement a feature fusion mechanism by concatenating the initial encoded representation with the multi-channel embeddings along the channel dimension, significantly enhancing the classification performance of subsequent models. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that the proposed MSMCE module not only achieves substantial improvements in classification performance but also enhances computational efficiency and training stability, highlighting its effectiveness in raw MS data classification and its potential for robust application across diverse datasets.

NeatMS	Pre-processing		Yes	Available automated methods for peak detection in untargeted metabolomics suffer from poor precision. We present NeatMS, which uses machine learning based on a convoluted neural network to reduce the number and fraction of false peaks. NeatMS comes with a pre-trained model representing expert knowledge in the differentiation of true chemical signal from noise. Furthermore, it provides all necessary functions to easily train new models or improve existing ones by transfer learning. Thus, the tool improves peak curation and contributes to the robust and scalable analysis of large-scale experiments. We show how to integrate it into different liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis workflows, quantify its performance, and compare it to various other approaches. NeatMS software is available as open source on github under permissive MIT license and is also provided as easy-to-install PyPi and Bioconda packages.

PeakBot	Pre-processing		Yes	Motivation Chromatographic peak picking is among the first steps in data processing workflows of raw LC-HRMS datasets in untargeted metabolomics applications. Its performance is crucial for the holistic detection of all metabolic features as well as their relative quantification for statistical analysis and metabolite identification. Random noise, non-baseline separated compounds and unspecific background signals complicate this task. Results A machine-learning-based approach entitled PeakBot was developed for detecting chromatographic peaks in LC-HRMS profile-mode data. It first detects all local signal maxima in a chromatogram, which are then extracted as super-sampled standardized areas (retention-time versus m/z). These are subsequently inspected by a custom-trained convolutional neural network that forms the basis of PeakBot’s architecture. The model reports if the respective local maximum is the apex of a chromatographic peak or not as well as its peak center and bounding box. In training and independent validation datasets used for development, PeakBot achieved a high performance with respect to discriminating between chromatographic peaks and background signals (accuracy of 0.99). For training the machine-learning model a minimum of 100 reference features are needed to learn their characteristics to achieve high-quality peak-picking results for detecting such chromatographic peaks in an untargeted fashion. PeakBot is implemented in python (3.8) and uses the TensorFlow (2.5.0) package for machine-learning related tasks. It has been tested on Linux and Windows OSs.

PeakDecoder	Pre-processing		Yes	Multidimensional measurements using state-of-the-art separations and mass spectrometry provide advantages in untargeted metabolomics analyses for studying biological and environmental bio-chemical processes. However, the lack of rapid analytical methods and robust algorithms for these heterogeneous data has limited its application. Here, we develop and evaluate a sensitive and high-throughput analytical and computational workflow to enable accurate metabolite profiling. Our workflow combines liquid chromatography, ion mobility spectrometry and data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry with PeakDecoder, a machine learning-based algorithm that learns to distinguish true co-elution and co-mobility from raw data and calculates metabolite identification error rates. We apply PeakDecoder for metabolite profiling of various engineered strains of Aspergillus pseudoterreus, Aspergillus niger, Pseudomonas putida and Rhodosporidium toruloides. Results, validated manually and against selected reaction monitoring and gas-chromatography platforms, show that 2683 features could be confidently annotated and quantified across 116 microbial sample runs using a library built from 64 standards.

PeakDetective	Pre-processing		Yes	Peak-detection algorithms currently used to process untargeted metabolomics data were designed to maximize sensitivity at the sacrifice of selectively. Peak lists returned by conventional software tools therefore contain a high density of artifacts that do not represent real chemical analytes, which, in turn, hinder downstream analyses. Although some innovative approaches to remove artifacts have recently been introduced, they involve extensive user intervention due to the diversity of peak shapes present within and across metabolomics data sets. To address this bottleneck in metabolomics data processing, we developed a semisupervised deep learning-based approach, PeakDetective, for classification of detected peaks as artifacts or true peaks. Our approach utilizes two techniques for artifact removal. First, an unsupervised autoencoder is used to extract a low-dimensional, latent representation of each peak. Second, a classifier is trained with active learning to discriminate between artifacts and true peaks. Through active learning, the classifier is trained with less than 100 user-labeled peaks in a matter of minutes. Given the speed of its training, PeakDetective can be rapidly tailored to specific LC/MS methods and sample types to maximize performance on each type of data set. In addition to curation, the trained models can also be utilized for peak detection to immediately detect peaks with both high sensitivity and selectivity. We validated PeakDetective on five diverse LC/MS data sets, where PeakDetective showed greater accuracy compared to current approaches. When applied to a SARS-CoV-2 data set, PeakDetective enabled more statistically significant metabolites to be detected. PeakDetective is open source and available as a Python package at https://github.com/pattilab/PeakDetective.

QuanFormer	Pre-processing		Yes	In metabolomic analysis based on liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry, detecting and quantifying intricate objects is a massive job. Current peak picking methods still cause high rates of incorrectly picked peaks to influence the reliability and reproducibility of results. To address these challenges, we developed QuanFormer, a deep learning method based on object detection designed to accurately quantify peak signals. Our algorithm combines the feature extraction capabilities of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with the global computation capability of Transformer architecture. Data training in QuanFormer by using nearly 20,000 annotated regions-of-interest (ROIs) ensures unique prediction via bipartite matching, achieving 96.5% of the average precision value on the test set. Even without retraining, QuanFormer achieves over 90% accuracy in distinguishing true from false peaks. Performance was further analyzed using visualization techniques applied to the encoder and decoder layers. We also demonstrated that QuanFormer could correct retention time shifts for peak alignment and generally surpass the existing methods, including MZmine 3 and PeakDetective, to obtain a larger number of picked peaks and higher accurate quantification. Finally, we also carried out metabolomic analysis in a clinical cohort of breast cancer patients and utilized QuanFormer to detect and quantify the potential biomarkers.

MARS (MetAbolomics ReSearch)	Pre-processing/Exposomics			Untargeted metabolomics is a growing field, in which recent advances in high-resolution mass spectrometry coupled with liquid chromatography (LC-MS) have facilitated untargeted approaches as a result of improvements in sensitivity, mass accuracy, and resolving power. However, a very large amount of data are generated. Consequently, using computational tools is now mandatory for the in-depth analysis of untargeted metabolomics data. This article describes MetAbolomics ReSearch (MARS), an all-in-one vendor-agnostic graphical user interface-based software applying LC-MS analysis to untargeted metabolomics. All of the analytical steps are described (from instrument data conversion and processing to statistical analysis, annotation/identification, quantification, and preliminary biological interpretation), and tools developed to improve annotation accuracy (e.g., multiple adducts and in-source fragmentation detection, trends across samples, and the MS/MS validator) are highlighted. In addition, MARS allows in-house building of reference databases, to bypass the limits of freely available MS/MS spectra collections. Focusing on the flexibility of the software and its user-friendliness, which are two important features in multipurpose software, MARS could provide new perspectives in untargeted metabolomics data analysis.

COVRECON	Specialized		Yes	Physical inactivity and a weak fitness status have become a global health concern. Metabolomics, as an integrative systematic approach, might link to individuals fitness at the molecular level. In this study, we performed blood samples metabolomics analysis of a cohort of elderly people with different treatments. By defining two groups of fitness and corresponding metabolites profiles, we tested several machine learning classification approaches to identify key metabolite biomarkers, which showed robustly aspartate as a dominant negative marker of fitness. Following, the metabolomics data of the two groups were analyzed by a novel approach for metabolic network interaction termed COVRECON. Where we identified the enzyme AST as the most important metabolic regulation between the fit and the less fit groups. Routine blood tests in these two cohorts validated significant differences in AST and ALT. In summary, we combine machine learning classification and COVRECON to identify metabolomics biomarkers and causal processes for fitness of elderly people.

IDSL.IPA	Pre-processing			Generating comprehensive and high-fidelity metabolomics data matrices from LC/HRMS data remains to be extremely challenging for population-scale large studies (n > 200). Here, we present a new data processing pipeline, the Intrinsic Peak Analysis (IDSL.IPA) R package (https://ipa.idsl.me), to generate such data matrices specifically for organic compounds. The IDSL.IPA pipeline incorporates (1) identifying potential 12C and 13C ion pairs in individual mass spectra; (2) detecting and characterizing chromatographic peaks using a new sensitive and versatile approach to perform mass correction, peak smoothing, baseline development for local noise measurement, and peak quality determination; (3) correcting retention time and cross-referencing peaks from multiple samples by a dynamic retention index marker approach; (4) annotating peaks using a reference database of m/z and retention time; and (5) accelerating data processing using a parallel computation of the peak detection and alignment steps for larger studies. This pipeline has been successfully evaluated for studies ranging from 200 to 1600 samples. By specifically isolating high quality and reliable signals pertaining to carbon-containing compounds in untargeted LC/HRMS data sets from larger studies, IDSL.IPA opens new opportunities for discovering new biological insights in the population-scale metabolomics and exposomics projects. The package is available in the R CRAN repository at https://cran.r-project.org/package=IDSL.IPA.

ISFrag	Pre-processing			In-source fragmentation (ISF) is a naturally occurring phenomenon during electrospray ionization (ESI) in liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) analysis. ISF leads to false metabolite annotation in untargeted metabolomics, prompting misinterpretation of the underlying biological mechanisms. Conventional metabolomic data cleaning mainly focuses on the annotation of adducts and isotopes, and the recognition of ISF features is mainly based on common neutral losses and the LC coelution pattern. In this work, we recognized three increasingly important patterns of ISF features, including (1) coeluting with their precursor ions, (2) being in the tandem MS (MS2) spectra of their precursor ions, and (3) sharing similar MS2 fragmentation patterns with their precursor ions. Based on these patterns, we developed an R package, ISFrag, to comprehensively recognize all possible ISF features from LC-MS data generated from full-scan, data-dependent acquisition, and data-independent acquisition modes without the assistance of common neutral loss information or MS2 spectral library. Tested using metabolite standards, we achieved a 100% correct recognition of level 1 ISF features and over 80% correct recognition for level 2 ISF features. Further application of ISFrag on untargeted metabolomics data allows us to identify ISF features that can potentially cause false metabolite annotation at an omics-scale. With the help of ISFrag, we performed a systematic investigation of how ISF features are influenced by different MS parameters, including capillary voltage, end plate offset, ion energy, and “collision energy”. Our results show that while increasing energies can increase the number of real metabolic features and ISF features, the percentage of ISF features might not necessarily increase. Finally, using ISFrag, we created an ISF pathway to visualize the relationships between multiple ISF features that belong to the same precursor ion.

ALISTER	Quality Control			Background and aims: In lipidomic and metabolomic studies, pre-analytical pitfalls enhance the risk of misusing resources such as time and money, as samples that are analyzed may not yield accurate or reliable data due to poor sample handling. Guidance and pre-analytic know-how are necessary for translation of omics technologies into routine clinical testing. The present work aims to enable decision making regarding sample stability in every phase of lipidomics- and metabolomics-centered studies.  Materials and methods: Data of multiple pre-analytic studies were aggregated into a database. Flexible approaches for evaluating these data were implemented in an RShiny-based web-application, tailored towards broad applicability in clinical and bioanalytic research.  Results: Our "Application for lipid stability evaluation & research" - ALISTER facilitates decision making on blood sample stability during lipidomic and metabolomic studies, such as biomarker research, analysis of biobank samples and clinical testing. The interactive tool gives sampling recommendations when planning sample collection or aids in the assessment of sample quality of experiments retrospectively.  Conclusion: ALISTER is available for use under https://itmp.shinyapps.io/alister/. The application enables and simplifies data-driven decision making concerning pre-analytic blood sample handling and fits the needs of clinical investigations from multiple perspectives.

CordBat	Quality Control			For a large-scale metabolomics study, sample collection, preparation, and analysis may last several days, months, or even (intermittently) over years. This may lead to apparent batch effects in the acquired metabolomics data due to variability in instrument status, environmental conditions, or experimental operators. Batch effects may confound the true biological relationships among metabolites and thus obscure real metabolic changes. At present, most of the commonly used batch effect correction (BEC) methods are based on quality control (QC) samples, which require sufficient and stable QC samples. However, the quality of the QC samples may deteriorate if the experiment lasts for a long time. Alternatively, isotope-labeled internal standards have been used, but they generally do not provide good coverage of the metabolome. On the other hand, BEC can also be conducted through a data-driven method, in which no QC sample is needed. Here, we propose a novel data-driven BEC method, namely, CordBat, to achieve concordance between each batch of samples. In the proposed CordBat method, a reference batch is first selected from all batches of data, and the remaining batches are referred to as “other batches.” The reference batch serves as the baseline for the batch adjustment by providing a coordinate of correlation between metabolites. Next, a Gaussian graphical model is built on the combined dataset of reference and other batches, and finally, BEC is achieved by optimizing the correction coefficients in the other batches so that the correlation between metabolites of each batch and their combinations are in concordance with that of the reference batch. Three real-world metabolomics datasets are used to evaluate the performance of CordBat by comparing it with five commonly used BEC methods. The present experimental results showed the effectiveness of CordBat in batch effect removal and the concordance of correlation between metabolites after BEC. CordBat was found to be comparable to the QC-based methods and achieved better performance in the preservation of biological effects. The proposed CordBat method may serve as an alternative BEC method for large-scale metabolomics that lack proper QC samples.

Dbnorm	Quality Control			As a powerful phenotyping technology, metabolomics provides new opportunities in biomarker discovery through metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS) and the identification of metabolites having a regulatory effect in various biological processes. While mass spectrometry-based (MS) metabolomics assays are endowed with high throughput and sensitivity, MWAS are doomed to long-term data acquisition generating an overtime-analytical signal drift that can hinder the uncovering of real biologically relevant changes. We developed “dbnorm”, a package in the R environment, which allows for an easy comparison of the model performance of advanced statistical tools commonly used in metabolomics to remove batch effects from large metabolomics datasets. “dbnorm” integrates advanced statistical tools to inspect the dataset structure not only at the macroscopic (sample batches) scale, but also at the microscopic (metabolic features) level. To compare the model performance on data correction, “dbnorm” assigns a score that help users identify the best fitting model for each dataset. In this study, we applied “dbnorm” to two large-scale metabolomics datasets as a proof of concept. We demonstrate that “dbnorm” allows for the accurate selection of the most appropriate statistical tool to efficiently remove the overtime signal drift and to focus on the relevant biological components of complex datasets.

hRUV	Quality Control			Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry-based metabolomics studies are increasingly applied to large population cohorts, which run for several weeks or even years in data acquisition. This inevitably introduces unwanted intra- and inter-batch variations over time that can overshadow true biological signals and thus hinder potential biological discoveries. To date, normalisation approaches have struggled to mitigate the variability introduced by technical factors whilst preserving biological variance, especially for protracted acquisitions. Here, we propose a study design framework with an arrangement for embedding biological sample replicates to quantify variance within and between batches and a workflow that uses these replicates to remove unwanted variation in a hierarchical manner (hRUV). We use this design to produce a dataset of more than 1000 human plasma samples run over an extended period of time. We demonstrate significant improvement of hRUV over existing methods in preserving biological signals whilst removing unwanted variation for large scale metabolomics studies. Our tools not only provide a strategy for large scale data normalisation, but also provides guidance on the design strategy for large omics studies. Mass spectrometry-based metabolomics is a powerful method for profiling large clinical cohorts but batch variations can obscure biologically meaningful differences. Here, the authors develop a computational workflow that removes unwanted data variation while preserving biologically relevant information.

iDIA-QC	Quality Control			Quality control (QC) in mass spectrometry (MS)-based proteomics is mainly based on data-dependent acquisition (DDA) analysis of standard samples. Here, we collect 2754 files acquired by data independent acquisition (DIA) and paired 2638 DDA files from mouse liver digests using 21 mass spectrometers across nine laboratories over 31 months. Our data demonstrate that DIA-based LC-MS/MS-related consensus QC metrics exhibit higher sensitivity compared to DDA-based QC metrics in detecting changes in LC-MS status. We then prioritize 15 metrics and invite 21 experts to manually assess the quality of 2754 DIA files based on those metrics. We develop an AI model for DIA-based QC using 2110 training files. It achieves AUCs of 0.91 (LC) and 0.97 (MS) in the first validation dataset (n = 528), and 0.78 (LC) and 0.94 (MS) in an independent validation dataset (n = 116). Finally, we develop an offline software called iDIA-QC for convenient adoption of this methodology.	iDIA-QC: AI-empowered data-independent acquisition mass spectrometry-based quality control	https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-024-54871-1	Nature Communications	Gao, H., Zhu, Y., Wang, D., Nie, Z., Wang, H., Wang, G., ... & Guo, T.

InjectionDesign	Quality Control			Plate Design is a necessary and time-consuming operation for GC/LC-MS based sample preparation. The implementation of the inter-batch balancing algorithm and the intra-batch randomization algorithm can have a significant impact on the final analysis results. For researchers without programming skills, a stable and efficient online service for plate design is necessary. However, most exist products do not currently have online services, and are not optimized for GC/LC-MS instruments with custom injection capabilities. Here we describe InjectionDesign, a free online plate design service focus on GC/LC-MS-based multi-omics experiment design. It offers the ability to separate the position design from the sequence design, making the output more compatible with the requirements of a modern mass spectrometer-based laboratory. In addition, it has implemented an optimized block randomization algorithm, which can be better applied to sample stratification with block randomization for unbalanced distribution. It is easy to use, with built-in support for common instrument models and quick export to worksheet. InjectionDesign is an open-source project based on Java.

MAFFIN	Quality Control			Motivation Post-acquisition sample normalization is a critical step in comparative metabolomics to remove the variation introduced by sample amount or concentration difference. Previously reported approaches are either specific to one sample type or built on strong assumptions on data structure, which are limited to certain levels. This encouraged us to develop MAFFIN, an accurate and robust post-acquisition sample normalization workflow that works universally for metabolomics data collected on mass spectrometry (MS) platforms. Results  MAFFIN calculates normalization factors using maximal density fold change (MDFC) computed by a kernel density-based approach. Using both simulated data and 20 metabolomics datasets, we showcased that MDFC outperforms four commonly used normalization methods in terms of reducing the intragroup variation among samples. Two essential steps, overlooked in conventional methods, were also examined and incorporated into MAFFIN. (i) MAFFIN uses multiple orthogonal criteria to select high-quality features for normalization factor calculation, which minimizes the bias caused by abiotic features or metabolites with poor quantitative performance. (ii) MAFFIN corrects the MS signal intensities of high-quality features using serial quality control samples, which guarantees the accuracy of fold change calculations. MAFFIN was applied to a human saliva metabolomics study and led to better data separation in principal component analysis and more confirmed significantly altered metabolites. Availability and implementation  The MAFFIN algorithm was implemented in an R package named MAFFIN. Package installation, user instruction and demo data are available at https://github.com/HuanLab/MAFFIN. Other data in this work are available on request.

marr	Quality Control			Abstract BackgroundAssessing the reproducibility of measurements is an important first step for improving the reliability of downstream analyses of high-throughput metabolomics experiments. We define a metabolite to be reproducible when it demonstrates consistency across replicate experiments. Similarly, metabolites which are not consistent across replicates can be labeled as irreproducible. In this work, we introduce and evaluate the use (Ma)ximum (R)ank (R)eproducibility (MaRR) to examine reproducibility in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics experiments. We examine reproducibility across technical or biological samples in three different mass spectrometry metabolomics (MS-Metabolomics) data sets.ResultsWe apply MaRR, a nonparametric approach that detects the change from reproducible to irreproducible signals using a maximal rank statistic. The advantage of using MaRR over model-based methods that it does not make parametric assumptions on the underlying distributions or dependence structures of reproducible metabolites. Using three MS Metabolomics data sets generated in the multi-center Genetic Epidemiology of Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) study, we applied the MaRR procedure after data processing to explore reproducibility across technical or biological samples. Under realistic settings of MS-Metabolomics data, the MaRR procedure effectively controls the False Discovery Rate (FDR) when there was a gradual reduction in correlation between replicate pairs for less highly ranked signals. Simulation studies also show that the MaRR procedure tends to have high power for detecting reproducible metabolites in most situations except for smaller values of proportion of reproducible metabolites. Bias (i.e., the difference between the estimated and the true value of reproducible signal proportions) values for simulations are also close to zero. The results reported from the real data show a higher level of reproducibility for technical replicates compared to biological replicates across all the three different datasets. In summary, we demonstrate that the MaRR procedure application can be adapted to various experimental designs, and that the nonparametric approach performs consistently well.ConclusionsThis research was motivated by reproducibility, which has proven to be a major obstacle in the use of genomic findings to advance clinical practice. In this paper, we developed a data-driven approach to assess the reproducibility of MS-Metabolomics data sets.

MassQLab	Quality Control			Rationale Reproducible analytical instrumentation system performance is critical for mass spectrometry, particularly metabolomics, aptly named system suitability testing. We identified a need based on literature reports that stated only 2% of papers performed system suitability testing. Methods  We report MassQLab, built upon open-source, vendor-agnostic software called the mass spectrometry query language (MassQL). MassQL, implemented in MassQLab, provides freedom for researchers to choose their analyte/s, mass spectrometry system (including liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry), and metrics of performance. Results  In this report, we describe the use of MassQLab, demonstrate the construction of the required MassQL query, common metrics of performance (i.e., extracted ion chromatograms), uncommon metrics (i.e., MS/MS product ion spectra), and discuss insights gained about performance—including issues requiring correction prior to sample analysis. Conclusions  MassQLab is a flexible solution for system suitability testing for mass spectrometry-based analytical measurements. Deficits in analytical performance, while unavoidable and rare, were noted prior to data collection and corrected. The open-source and adaptable nature of MassQLab will empower researchers and lead to improved implementation of system suitability testing.

MatrixQCvis	Quality Control			Motivation First-line data quality assessment and exploratory data analysis are integral parts of any data analysis workflow. In high-throughput quantitative omics experiments (e.g. transcriptomics, proteomics, metabolomics), after initial processing, the data are typically presented as a matrix of numbers (feature IDs x samples). Efficient and standardized data-quality metrics calculation and visualization are key to track the within-experiment quality of these rectangular data types and to guarantee for high-quality data sets and subsequent biological question-driven inference.    ResultsWe present MatrixQCvis, which provides interactive visualization of data quality metrics at the per-sample and per-feature level using Rs shiny framework. It provides efficient and standardized ways to analyze data quality of quantitative omics data types that come in a matrix-like format (features IDs x samples). MatrixQCvis builds upon the Bioconductor SummarizedExperiment S4 class and thus facilitates the integration into existing workflows.    AvailabilityMatrixQCVis is implemented in R.

MetaMOPE	Quality Control			Motivation Liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is widely used in metabolomics studies, while HILIC LC-MS is particularly suited for polar metabolites. Determining an optimized mobile phase and developing a proper liquid chromatography method tend to be laborious, time-consuming and empirical. Results  We developed a containerized web tool providing a workflow to quickly determine the optimized mobile phase by batch-evaluating chromatography peaks for metabolomics LC-MS studies. A mass chromatographic quality value, an asymmetric factor, and the local maximum intensity of the extracted ion chromatogram were calculated to determine the number of peaks and peak retention time. The optimal mobile phase can be quickly determined by selecting the mobile phase that produces the largest number of resolved peaks. Moreover, the workflow enables one to automatically process the repeats by evaluating chromatography peaks and determining the retention time of large standards. This workflow was validated with 20 chemical standards and successfully constructed a reference library of 571 metabolites for the HILIC LC-MS platform.

MetaPro	Quality Control			Abstract   Introduction   Metabolomics analysis based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) has been a prevalent method in the metabolic field. However, accurately quantifying all the metabolites in large metabolomics sample cohorts is challenging. The analysis efficiency is restricted by the abilities of software in many labs, and the lack of spectra for some metabolites also hinders metabolite identification.      Objectives   Develop software that performs semi-targeted metabolomics analysis with an optimized workflow to improve quantification accuracy. The software also supports web-based technologies and increases laboratory analysis efficiency. A spectral curation function is provided to promote the prosperity of homemade MS/MS spectral libraries in the metabolomics community.      Methods   MetaPro is developed based on an industrial-grade web framework and a computation-oriented MS data format to improve analysis efficiency. Algorithms from mainstream metabolomics software are integrated and optimized for more accurate quantification results. A semi-targeted analysis workflow is designed based on the concept of combining artificial judgment and algorithm inference.      Results   MetaPro supports semi-targeted analysis workflow and functions for fast QC inspection and self-made spectral library curation with easy-to-use interfaces. With curated authentic or high-quality spectra, it can improve identification accuracy using different peak identification strategies. It demonstrates practical value in analyzing large amounts of metabolomics samples.      Conclusion   We offer MetaPro as a web-based application characterized by fast batch QC inspection and credible spectral curation towards high-throughput metabolomics data. It aims to resolve the analysis difficulty in semi-targeted metabolomics.

MSNORM	Quality Control		Yes	To achieve high quality omics results, systematic variability in mass spectrometry (MS) data must be adequately addressed. Effective data normalization is essential for minimizing this variability. The abundance of approaches and the data-dependent nature of normalization have led some researchers to develop open-source academic software for choosing the best approach. While these tools are certainly beneficial to the community, none of them meet all of the needs of all users, particularly users who want to test new strategies that are not available in these products. Herein, we present a simple and straightforward workflow that facilitates the identification of optimal normalization strategies using straightforward evaluation metrics, employing both supervised and unsupervised machine learning. The workflow offers a “DIY” aspect, where the performance of any normalization strategy can be evaluated for any type of MS data. As a demonstration of its utility, we apply this workflow on two distinct datasets, an ESI-MS dataset of extracted lipids from latent fingerprints and a cancer spheroid dataset of metabolites ionized by MALDI-MSI, for which we identified the best-performing normalization strategies.

Msquality	Quality Control			Motivation Multiple factors can impact accuracy and reproducibility of mass spectrometry data. There is a need to integrate quality assessment and control into data analytic workflows. Results The MsQuality package calculates 43 low-level quality metrics based on the controlled mzQC vocabulary defined by the HUPO-PSI on a single mass spectrometry-based measurement of a sample. It helps to identify low-quality measurements and track data quality. Its use of community-standard quality metrics facilitates comparability of quality assessment and control (QA/QC) criteria across datasets.

MultiBaC	Quality Control			Motivation Batch effects in omics datasets are usually a source of technical noise that masks the biological signal and hampers data analysis. Batch effect removal has been widely addressed for individual omics technologies. However, multi-omic datasets may combine data obtained in different batches where omics type and batch are often confounded. Moreover, systematic biases may be introduced without notice during data acquisition, which creates a hidden batch effect. Current methods fail to address batch effect correction in these cases. Results  In this article, we introduce the MultiBaC R package, a tool for batch effect removal in multi-omics and hidden batch effect scenarios. The package includes a diversity of graphical outputs for model validation and assessment of the batch effect correction. Availability and implementation  MultiBaC package is available on Bioconductor (https://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/MultiBaC.html) and GitHub (https://github.com/ConesaLab/MultiBaC.git).

mzQuality	Quality Control			Analyzing metabolites using mass spectrometry provides valuable insight into an individual’s health or disease status. However, various sources of experimental variation can be introduced during sample handling, preparation, and measurement, which can negatively affect the data. Quality assurance and quality control practices are essential to ensuring accurate and reproducible metabolomics data. These practices include measuring reference samples to monitor instrument stability, blank samples to evaluate the background signal, and strategies to correct for changes in instrumental performance. In this context, we introduce mzQuality, a user-friendly, open-source R-Shiny app designed to assess and correct technical variations in mass spectrometry-based metabolomics data. It processes peak-integrated data independently of vendor software and provides essential quality control features, including batch correction, outlier detection, and background signal assessment, and it visualizes trends in signal or retention time. We demonstrate its functionality using a data set of 419 samples measured across six batches, including quality control samples. mzQuality visualizes data through sample plots, PCA plots, and violin plots, which illustrate its ability to reduce the effect of experiment variation. Compound quality is further assessed by evaluating the relative standard deviation of quality control samples and the background signal from blank samples. Based on these quality metrics, compounds are classified into confidence levels. mzQuality provides an accessible solution to improve the data quality without requiring prior programming skills. Its customizable settings integrate seamlessly into research workflows, enhancing the accuracy and reproducibility of the metabolomics data. Additionally, with an R-compatible output, the data are ready for statistical analysis and biological interpretation.	mzQuality: An Open-Source Software Tool for Quality Monitoring and Reporting of Targeted Mass Spectrometry Measurements	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/jasms.5c00073	Journal of the American Society for Mass Spectrometry	van der Peet, M., Maas, P., Wegrzyn, A., Lamont, L., Fleming, R., Bordes, C., ...

OSCA Finder	Quality Control		Yes	Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a platform for urine and blood sample analysis. However, the high variability in the urine sample reduced the confidence of metabolite identification. Therefore, pre and post-calibration operations are inevitable to ensure an accurate urine biomarker analysis. In this study, the phenomenon of a higher creatinine concentration variable in ureteropelvic junction obstruction (UPJO) patient urine samples than in healthy people was revealed, indicating the urine biomarker discovery of UPJO patients is not adapted to the creatinine calibrate strategy. Therefore, we proposed a pipeline “OSCA-Finder” to reshape the urine biomarker analysis. First, to ensure a more stable peak shape and total ion chromatography, we applied the product of osmotic pressure and injection volume as a calibration principle and integrated it with an online mixer dilution. Therefore, we obtained the most peaks and identified more metabolites in a urine sample with peak area group CV<30%. A data-enhanced strategy was applied to reduce the overfit while training a neural network binary classifier with an accuracy of 99.9%. Finally, seven accurate urine biomarkers combined with a binary classifier were applied to distinguish UPJO patients from healthy people. The results show that the UPJO diagnostic strategy based on urine osmotic pressure calibration has more potential than ordinary strategies.

Paramounter	Quality Control			Choosing appropriate data processing parameters is critical in processing liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS)-based untargeted metabolomics data. The conventional design of experiments (DOE) approach is time-consuming and provides no intuitive explanation why the selected parameters generate the best results. After studying commonly used metabolomics data processing software, this work summarized a set of universal parameters, including mass tolerance, peak height, peak width, and instrumental shift. These universal parameters are shared among different feature extraction programs and are critical to metabolic feature extraction. We then developed Paramounter, an R program that automatically measures these universal parameters from raw LC–MS-based metabolomics data prior to metabolic feature extraction. This is made possible through novel concepts of rank-based intensity sorting, zone of interest, and many others. Paramounter also translates universal parameters to software-specific parameters for data processing in different programs. Applying Paramounter is demonstrated to provide a threefold increase in the extracted metabolites compared to using default parameters in MS-DIAL-based feature extraction. Furthermore, the comparison between Paramounter, AutoTuner, and IPO showed that Paramounter generates 3.7- and 1.6-fold more true positive features than AutoTuner and IPO, respectively. Further validation of Paramounter on 11 datasets covering different sample types, data acquisition modes, and MS vendors proved that Paramounter is a convenient and robust program. Overall, the proposed universal parameters and the development of Paramounter address a critical need in metabolomics data processing, transforming metabolomics feature extraction from a “black box” to a “white box.” Paramounter is freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/HuanLab/Paramounter).

PeakQC	Quality Control			Mass spectrometry is broadly employed to study complex molecular mechanisms in various biological and environmental fields, enabling 'omics' research such as proteomics, metabolomics, and lipidomics. As study cohorts grow larger and more complex with dozens to hundreds of samples, the need for robust quality control (QC) measures through automated software tools becomes paramount to ensure the integrity, high quality, and validity of scientific conclusions from downstream analyses and minimize the waste of resources. Since existing QC tools are mostly dedicated to proteomics, automated solutions supporting metabolomics are needed. To address this need, we developed the software PeakQC, a tool for automated QC of MS data that is independent of omics molecular types (i.e., omics-agnostic). It allows automated extraction and inspection of peak metrics of precursor ions (e.g., errors in mass, retention time, arrival time) and supports various instrumentations and acquisition types, from infusion experiments or using liquid chromatography and/or ion mobility spectrometry front-end separations and with/without fragmentation spectra from data-dependent or independent acquisition analyses. Diagnostic plots for fragmentation spectra are also generated. Here, we describe and illustrate PeakQC’s functionalities using different representative data sets, demonstrating its utility as a valuable tool for enhancing the quality and reliability of omics mass spectrometry analyses.

QC4Metabolomics	Quality Control			Motivation The ability to answer complex biological questions in metabolomics relies on the acquisition of high-quality data. However, due to the complex nature of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry acquisition, data quality checks are often not done comprehensively and only at the post-processing step. This can be too late to mitigate analytical problems such as loss of m/z calibration, retention time drift and severe ion suppression. It is often not practically or economically feasible to reanalyze samples, and interpretation of the acquired compromised data, if at all possible, is limited, despite the considerable expenses incurred to obtain them.    ResultsWe therefore introduce QC4Metabolomics, a real-time quality control monitoring software for untargeted metabolomics data. QC4Metabolomics monitors files as they are acquired or retrospectively by tracking any user-defined compound(s) and extracting diagnostic information such as observed m/z, retention time, intensity and peak shape, and presents the results on a web dashboard. QC4Metabolomics also monitors the levels of common or user-defined contaminants. We report herein real-world examples where QC4Metabolomics easily reveals analytical problems retrospectively that could have been immediately addressed with real-time monitoring, so that the samples would have been analyzed without any quality control issues.    Availability and ImplementationQC4Metabolomics is available as code at https://github.com/stanstrup/QC4Metabolomics. A Docker image, a docker-compose setup file and demo data are also provided for easy deployment.

QComics	Quality Control			The implementation of quality control strategies is crucial to ensure the reproducibility, accuracy, and meaningfulness of metabolomics data. However, this pivotal step is often overlooked within the metabolomics workflow and frequently relies on the use of nonstandardized and poorly reported protocols. To address current limitations in this respect, we have developed QComics, a robust, easily implementable and reportable method for monitoring and controlling data quality. The protocol operates in various sequential steps aimed to (i) correct for background noise and carryover, (ii) detect signal drifts and “out-of-control” observations, (iii) deal with missing data, (iv) remove outliers, (v) monitor quality markers to identify samples affected by improper collection, preprocessing, or storage, and (vi) assess overall data quality in terms of precision and accuracy. Notably, this tool considers important issues often neglected along quality control, such as the need of separately handling missing values and truly absent data to avoid losing relevant biological information, as well as the large impact that preanalytical factors may elicit on metabolomics results. Altogether, the guidelines compiled in QComics might contribute to establishing gold standard recommendations and best practices for quality control within the metabolomics community.

QuantyFey	Quality Control			Background Signal intensity drift is a well-recognized issue in quantitative LC-MS(MS) analysis, especially during long analytical sequences or when internal standards (IS) are unavailable. While IS correction is widely supported by commercial platforms, other correction strategies, such as quality control (QC)-based drift correction, or quantification bracketing, are unavailable. This limits the ability of analysts to maintain data quality in more complex or resource-limited experimental setups. To address this, we developed QuantyFey, an open-source, vendor-independent tool for external calibration-based quantification, with support for multiple drift correction strategies. Results We applied QuantyFey to a targeted LC-MS/MS dataset comprising amino acids, amino acid-related metabolites, and biogenic amines measured in porcine plasma. The dataset was affected by substantial signal drift across the run. A calibration standard was used as a proxy for a QC sample and different drift correction strategies were compared: IS correction, QC-based drift correction, custom bracketing and weighted bracketing. Concentrations of all compounds were calculated using different drift correction strategies and manual tuning of calibration functions, and remaining intensity drift was assessed. Both QC-based and IS-based correction significantly reduced drift effects. Custom- or weighted bracketing methods also improved quantification accuracy but demonstrated variable performance across compounds. This study highlights the importance of evaluating compound-specific behavior when selecting drift correction strategies. Significance QuantyFey offers a transparent and accessible framework for quantitative LC-MS(MS) analysis, especially in situations where drift correction is critical and IS are limited. Its flexible design allows for compound-specific evaluation and quantification, making it a practical tool for handling complex datasets. By supporting tailored drift correction strategies, QuantyFey addresses key challenges in maintaining data quality and reproducibility.

Rapid QC-MS	Quality Control			Consistently collecting high-quality liquid chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) data is a time-consuming hurdle for untargeted workflows. Analytical controls such as internal and biological standards are commonly included in high-throughput workflows, helping researchers recognize low-integrity specimens regardless of their biological source. However, evaluating these standards as data are collected has remained a considerable bottleneck─in both person-hours and accuracy. Here we present Rapid QC-MS, an automated, interactive dashboard for assessing LC-MS/MS data quality. Minutes after a new data file is written, a browser-viewable dashboard is updated with quality control results spanning multiple performance dimensions such as instrument sensitivity, in-run retention time shifts, and mass accuracy drift. Rapid QC-MS provides interactive visualizations that help users recognize acute deviations in these performance metrics, as well as gradual drifts over periods of hours, days, months, or years. Rapid QC-MS is open-source, simple to install, and highly configurable. By integrating open-source Python libraries and widely used MS analysis software, it can adapt to any LC-MS/MS workflow. Rapid QC-MS runs locally and offers optional remote quality control by syncing with Google Drive. Furthermore, Rapid QC-MS can operate in a semiautonomous fashion, alerting users to specimens with potentially poor analytical integrity via frequently used messaging applications. Initially developed for integration with Thermo Orbitrap workflows, Rapid QC-MS offers a fast, straightforward approach to help users collect high-quality untargeted LC-MS/MS data by eliminating many of the most time-consuming steps in manual data curation.

Among the many factors that impact the outcome of any experiment in proteomics is the LC–MS system performance, which should be monitored within each specific experiment and also long term. This process is termed quality control (QC). We present an easy-to-use tool that rapidly produces a visual, HTML-based report that includes the key parameters needed to monitor the LC–MS system performance, with a focus on monitoring the performance within an experiment. The tool, named RawBeans, generates a report for individual files or for a set of samples from a whole experiment. We anticipate that it will help proteomics users and experts evaluate raw data quality independent of data processing. The tool is available at https://bitbucket.org/incpm/prot-qc/downloads. The mass-spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE partner repository with the data set identifier PXD022816.

Regularized Adversarial Learning Preserving Similarity (RALPS)	Quality Control			Motivation Untargeted metabolomics by mass spectrometry is the method of choice for unbiased analysis of molecules in complex samples of biological, clinical or environmental relevance. The exceptional versatility and sensitivity of modern high-resolution instruments allows profiling of thousands of known and unknown molecules in parallel. Inter-batch differences constitute a common and unresolved problem in untargeted metabolomics, and hinder the analysis of multi-batch studies or the intercomparison of experiments. Results  We present a new method, Regularized Adversarial Learning Preserving Similarity (RALPS), for the normalization of multi-batch untargeted metabolomics data. RALPS builds on deep adversarial learning with a three-term loss function that mitigates batch effects while preserving biological identity, spectral properties and coefficients of variation. Using two large metabolomics datasets, we showcase the superior performance of RALPS as compared with six state-of-the-art methods for batch correction. Further, we demonstrate that RALPS scales well, is robust, deals with missing values and can handle different experimental designs.

WaveICA 2.0	Quality Control			Introduction Untargeted metabolomics based on liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry is inevitably affected by batch effects that are caused by non-biological systematic bias. Previously, we developed a novel method called WaveICA to remove batch effects for untargeted metabolomics data. To detect batch effect information, the method relies on a batch label. However, it cannot be used in the scenario in which there is only one batch of data or the batch label is unknown. Objectives  We aim to improve the WaveICA method to remove batch effects for untargeted metabolomics data without using batch information. Methods  We improved the WaveICA method by developing WaveICA 2.0 to remove batch effects for metabolomics data, and provided an R package WaveICA_2.0 to implement this method. Results  The performance of the WaveICA 2.0 method was evaluated on real metabolomics data. For metabolomics data with three batches, the performance of the WaveICA 2.0 method was similar to that of the WaveICA method in terms of gathering quality control samples (QCSs) and subject samples together in principle component analysis score plots, increasing the similarity of QCSs, increasing differential peaks, and improving classification accuracy. For metabolomics data with only one batch, the WaveICA 2.0 method had a strong ability to remove intensity drift and reveal more biological information and outperformed the QC-RLSC and QC-SVRC methods in our study using our metabolomics data. Conclusion  Our results demonstrated that the WaveICA 2.0 method can be used in practice to remove batch effects for untargeted metabolomics data without batch information.

ReTimeML	RT			AbstractThe analysis of ceramide (Cer) and sphingomyelin (SM) lipid species using liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC–MS/MS) continues to present challenges as their precursor mass and fragmentation can correspond to multiple molecular arrangements. To address this constraint, we developed ReTimeML, a freeware that automates the expected retention times (RTs) for Cer and SM lipid profiles from complex chromatograms. ReTimeML works on the principle that LC–MS/MS experiments have pre-determined RTs from internal standards, calibrators or quality controls used throughout the analysis. Employed as reference RTs, ReTimeML subsequently extrapolates the RTs of unknowns using its machine-learned regression library of mass-to-charge (m/z) versus RT profiles, which does not require model retraining for adaptability on different LC–MS/MS pipelines. We validated ReTimeML RT estimations for various Cer and SM structures across different biologicals, tissues and LC–MS/MS setups, exhibiting a mean variance between 0.23 and 2.43% compared to user annotations. ReTimeML also aided the disambiguation of SM identities from isobar distributions in paired serum-cerebrospinal fluid from healthy volunteers, allowing us to identify a series of non-canonical SMs associated between the two biofluids comprised of a polyunsaturated structure that confers increased stability against catabolic clearance.

RI-based-CPSC	RT			Peak alignment is a crucial step in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based large-scale untargeted metabolomics workflows, as it enables the integration of metabolite peaks across multiple samples, which is essential for accurate data interpretation. Slight differences or fluctuations in chromatographic separation conditions, however, can cause the chromatographic retention time (RT) shift between consecutive analyses, ultimately affecting the accuracy of peak alignment between samples. Here, we introduce a novel RT shift correction method based on the retention index (RI) and apply it to peak alignment. We synthesized a series of N-acyl glycine (C2–C23) homologues via the amidation reaction between glycine with normal saturated fatty acids (C2–C23) as calibrants able to respond proficiently in both mass spectrometric positive- and negative-ion modes. Using these calibrants, we established an N-acyl glycine RI system. This RI system is capable of covering a broad chromatographic space and addressing chromatographic RT shift caused by variations in flow rate, gradient elution, instrument systems, and LC separation columns. Moreover, based on the RI system, we developed a peak shift correction model to enhance peak alignment accuracy. Applying the model resulted in a significant improvement in the accuracy of peak alignment from 15.5 to 80.9% across long-term data spanning a period of 157 days. To facilitate practical application, we developed a Python-based program, which is freely available at https://github.com/WHU-Fenglab/RI-based-CPSC.

ROASMI	RT			Abstract   The limited replicability of retention data hinders its application in untargeted metabolomics for small molecule identification. While retention order models hold promise in addressing this issue, their predictive reliability is limited by uncertain generalizability. Here, we present the ROASMI model, which enables reliable prediction of retention order within a well-defined application domain by coupling data-driven molecular representation and mechanistic insights. The generalizability of ROASMI is proven by 71 independent reversed-phase liquid chromatography (RPLC) datasets. The application of ROASMI to four real-world datasets demonstrates its advantages in distinguishing coexisting isomers with similar fragmentation patterns and in annotating detection peaks without informative spectra. ROASMI is flexible enough to be retrained with user-defined reference sets and is compatible with other MS/MS scorers, making further improvements in small-molecule identification.

ABCoRT	RT		Yes	Liquid chromatography retention time (RT) prediction plays a crucial role in metabolite identification, a challenging and essential task in untargeted metabolomics. Accurate molecular representation is vital for reliable RT prediction. To address this, we propose a novel molecular representation learning framework, ABCoRT(Atom-Bond Co-learning for Retention Time prediction), designed for predicting metabolite retention times. Our model transforms molecular graphs into dual hypergraphs, enabling the collaborative updating of atomic and bond information within both molecular graphs and hypergraphs, thereby producing highly informative molecular representations. We evaluated ABCoRT on a large-scale Small Molecule Retention Time (SMRT) data set comprising 80,038 molecules. Our model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 25.75 s and a mean relative error (MRE) of 3.24% after removing nonretained molecules. Additionally, we fine-tuned pretrained ABCoRT models on six additional data sets from PredRet, achieving the lowest MAEs on five of them. Additionally, in metabolite screening conducted on the MetaboBASE and RIKEN_PlaSM data sets from the MassBank of North America, ABCoRT demonstrates its capability to filter out 38.35 and 28.46% of candidate compounds, respectively.

AsRTNet	RT		Yes	Arsenic speciation exhibits remarkable diversity in environmental and biological systems, where accurate identification of individual species is essential for understanding distribution, metabolism, and toxicity profiles. Structural elucidation remains challenging due to complex metabolite networks particularly isomers which complicate mass spectrometry-based identification even with high-resolution accurate mass spectrometry. To address the scarcity of reference standards and labeled data, we established the As-RT dataset using HPLC-ICP-MS analysis of 22 arsenic compound standards. Comparative evaluation of traditional machine learning and transfer learning strategies revealed that ImageMol with molecular image enhancements displayed superior performance on this limited dataset. Based on data augmentation and contrastive learning, we developed AsRTNet a multimodal feature fusion model by integrating 1) fine-tuned ImageMol features for structural representation, 2) CDDD embeddings for chemical knowledge transfer, and 3) Mordred descriptors for physicochemical interpretability. This architecture achieved exceptional prediction accuracy (R²=0.9456, RMSE=39.13) on As-RT. SHAP analysis and feature maps further elucidated structural determinants of retention behavior. Our approach advances arsenic compound characterization and provides a powerful tool for predicting retention times of unknown metabolites in non-targeted analyses, significantly enhancing environmental risk assessment capabilities.

CMM-RT	RT		Yes	Retention time information is used for metabolite annotation in metabolomic experiments, but its usefulness is hindered by the availability of experimental retention time data and by the lack of reproducibility between chromatographic methods. We trained state‑of‑the‑art machine‑learning regressors using the 80 038 experimental retention times from the METLIN Small Molecule Retention Time (SMRT) dataset. The models included deep neural networks, deep kernel learning, gradient boosting models, and a blending approach. Thousands of molecular descriptors and fingerprints were generated with alvaDesc software. Bayesian hyper‑parameter search and nested cross‑validation were employed. The best results were obtained by a heavily regularized deep neural network trained with cosine annealing warm restarts and stochastic weight averaging, achieving mean and median absolute errors of 39.2 ± 1.2 s and 17.2 ± 0.9 s, respectively. To project retention times between chromatographic methods, we propose a Bayesian meta‑learning approach that can learn from as few as 10 molecules, enabling integration of deep‑learning RT predictions and a given chromatographic method to produce z‑scores for candidate annotations. In 68% of the cases the correct molecule was among the top three candidates filtered by mass and ranked according to z‑scores.

DeepGCN-RT	RT		Yes	The retention time (RT) is a crucial source of data for liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS). A model that can accurately predict the RT for each molecule would empower filtering candidates with similar spectra but differing RT in LCMS-based molecule identification. Recent research shows that graph neural networks (GNNs) outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in RT prediction. However, all of these models use relatively shallow GNNs. This study for the first time investigates how depth affects GNNs' performance on RT prediction. The results demonstrate that a notable improvement can be achieved by pushing the depth of GNNs to 16 layers by the adoption of residual connection. Additionally, we also find that graph convolutional network (GCN) model benefits from the edge information. The developed deep graph convolutional network, DeepGCN-RT, significantly outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method and achieves the lowest mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.3% and the lowest mean absolute error (MAE) of 26.55 s on the SMRT test set. We also finetune DeepGCN-RT on seven datasets with various chromatographic conditions. The mean MAE of the seven datasets largely decreases 30% compared to previous state-of-the-art method. On the RIKEN-PlaSMA dataset, we also test the effectiveness of DeepGCN-RT in assisting molecular structure identification. By 30% lessening the number of potential structures, DeepGCN-RT is able to improve top-1 accuracy by about 11%.

DeepRTAlign	RT		Yes	Retention time (RT) alignment is a crucial step in liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based proteomic and metabolomic experiments, especially for large cohort studies. The most popular alignment tools are based on warping function method and direct matching method. However, existing tools can hardly handle monotonic and non-monotonic RT shifts simultaneously. Here, we develop a deep learning-based RT alignment tool, DeepRTAlign, for large cohort LC-MS data analysis. DeepRTAlign has been demonstrated to have improved performances by benchmarking it against current state-of-the-art approaches on multiple real-world and simulated proteomic and metabolomic datasets. The results also show that DeepRTAlign can improve identification sensitivity without compromising quantitative accuracy. Furthermore, using the MS features aligned by DeepRTAlign, we trained and validated a robust classifier to predict the early recurrence of hepatocellular carcinoma. DeepRTAlign provides an advanced solution to RT alignment in large cohort LC-MS studies, which is currently a major bottleneck in proteomics and metabolomics research. Retention time (RT) alignment is a crucial step in large cohort proteomics and metabolomics studies. Here, the authors introduce DeepRTAlign, a deep learning tool for RT alignment that shows high identification sensitivity and quantitative accuracy.

DNNpwa‑TL	RT		Yes	Retention time (RT) prediction contributes to identification of small molecules measured by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with high-resolution mass spectrometry. Deep learning algorithms based on big data can enhance the accuracy of RT prediction. But at different chromatographic conditions, RTs of compounds are different, and the number of compounds with known RTs is small in most cases. Therefore, the transfer of big data is necessary. In this work, a strategy using a deep neural network (DNN) pretrained by weighed autoencoders and transfer learning (DNNpwa-TL) was proposed to efficiently predict RTs of compounds. The loss function in the autoencoders was calculated with features weighted by mutual information. Then, a DNN pretrained by weighted autoencoders (DNNpwa) was produced. For other specific chromatographic methods, the transfer learning model DNNpwa-TLs were built through fine-tuning the DNNpwa with the help of some compounds with known RTs to conduct the RT prediction. With the above strategy, a DNNpwa was first built with the METLIN small molecule retention time data set containing 80 038 small molecule compounds. A median relative error of 3.1% and a mean relative error of 4.9% were achieved. Then, 17 data sets from different chromatographic methods were studied, and the results showed that the performance of DNNpwa-TL was better than those of other deep learning models. Besides, DNNpwa-TL outperformed random forest, gradient boost, least absolute shrinkage and selection operator regression, and DNN for most of the 17 data sets. Therefore, DNNpwa-TL can provide an efficient method to perform RT prediction of small molecule compounds for different chromatographic methods and conditions.

GNN-RT	RT		Yes	The predicted liquid chromatographic retention times (RTs) of small molecules are not accurate enough for wide adoption in structural identification. In this study, we used the graph neural network to predict the retention time (GNN-RT) from structures of small molecules directly without the requirement of molecular descriptors. The predicted accuracy of GNN-RT was compared with random forests (RFs), Bayesian ridge regression, convolutional neural network (CNN), and a deep-learning regression model (DLM) on a METLIN small molecule retention time (SMRT) dataset. GNN-RT achieved the highest predicting accuracy with a mean relative error of 4.9% and a median relative error of 3.2%. Furthermore, the SMRT-trained GNN-RT model can be transferred to the same type of chromatographic systems easily. The predicted RT is valuable for structural identification in complementary to tandem mass spectra and can be used to assist in the identification of compounds. The results indicate that GNN-RT is a promising method to predict the RT for liquid chromatography and improve the accuracy of structural identification for small molecules.

Graphormer-RT	RT		Yes	Liquid chromatography (LC) is a cornerstone of analytical separations, but comparing the retention times (RTs) across different LC methods is challenging because of variations in experimental parameters such as column type and solvent gradient. Nevertheless, RTs are powerful metrics in tandem mass spectrometry (MS2) that can reduce false positive rates for metabolite annotation, differentiate isobaric species, and improve peptide identification. Here, we present Graphormer-RT, a novel graph transformer that performs the first single-model method-independent prediction of RTs. We use the RepoRT data set, which contains 142,688 reverse phase (RP) RTs (from 191 methods) and 4,373 HILIC RTs (from 49 methods). Our best RP model (trained and tested on 191 methods) achieved a test set mean average error (MAE) of 29.3 ± 0.6 s, comparable performance to the state-of-the-art model which was only trained on a single LC method. Our best-performing HILIC model achieved a test MAE = 42.4 ± 2.9 s. We expect that Graphormer-RT can be used as an LC “foundation model”, where transfer learning can reduce the amount of training data needed for highly accurate “specialist” models applied to method-specific RP and HILIC tasks. These frameworks could enable the machine optimization of automated LC workflows, improved filtration of candidate structures using predicted RTs, and the in silico annotation of unknown analytes in LC-MS2 measurements.

For instance, liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC‑MS) data analysis widely used during chemical synthesis can be considerably improved by predicting retention time (RT). With hundreds of thousands of syntheses per year at Enamine Ltd., a large amount of high quality data has been produced from this analysis. In this paper we report on the development of an RT prediction model based on the GATv2Conv+DL graph neural network (NN) using internal data and evaluation of the selected NN architecture with METLIN SMRT dataset. The final model shows a mean absolute error (MAE) value of 2.83 s for the 120‑s LC‑MS method. It was integrated into the existing in‑house LC‑MS viewing tool. We also performed a thorough analysis of RT prediction errors and suggested the range between RT – 11.34 s and RT + 10.68 s, as this interval contained over 95% of the data.

QGeoGNN	RT		Yes	The enantioseparation of chiral molecules is a crucial and challenging task in the field of experimental chemistry, often requiring extensive trial and error with different experimental settings. To overcome this challenge, here we show a research framework that employs machine learning techniques to predict retention times of enantiomers and facilitate chromatographic enantioseparation. A documentary dataset of chiral molecular retention times in high-performance liquid chromatography (CMRT dataset) is established to handle the challenge of data acquisition. A quantile geometry-enhanced graph neural network is proposed to learn the molecular structure-retention time relationship, which shows a satisfactory predictive ability for enantiomers. The domain knowledge of chromatography is incorporated into the machine learning model to achieve multi-column prediction, which paves the way for chromatographic enantioseparation prediction by calculating the separation probability. The proposed research framework works well in retention time prediction and chromatographic enantioseparation facilitation, which sheds light on the application of machine learning techniques to the experimental scene and improves the efficiency of experimenters to speed up scientific discovery.

retention_time_gnn	RT		Yes	Graph neural networks (GNNs) have shown remarkable performance in predicting the retention time (RT) for small molecules, but training data for a specific chromatographic system is often scarce because measuring RTs is costly. We present an improved transfer‑learning method that predicts molecular RTs for a target chromatographic system by learning from a small training data set with a pretrained GNN. A graph isomorphism network architecture is pretrained on the METLIN‑SMRT data set and then fine‑tuned on the target training data set using the limited‑memory Broyden–Fletcher–Goldfarb–Shanno optimizer with a learning‑rate decay schedule. The proposed method achieved superior predictive performance on various chromatographic systems compared with existing transfer‑learning methods, especially when only a small training data set was available. Future work could leverage multiple small training data sets from different chromatographic systems to further enhance generalization performance.

RT-Ensemble Pred	RT		Yes	Liquid chromatography‑mass spectrometry (LC‑MS) could provide a large amount of information to assist in metabolite identification. Different liquid chromatographic methods (CMs) could produce different retention times for the same metabolite. To predict retention times of local datasets by online datasets has become a trend, but the datasets downloaded from different databases vary in quantity. Imbalanced data could negatively influence model prediction. Thus, based on quantitative structure–retention relationships (QSRRs), an ensemble model, named RT‑Ensemble Pred, was built to predict retention times of different LC‑MS systems. A total of 76 807 metabolites (76 909 retention times) were collected across nine chromatographic methods; 19 natural products and one antifungal drug (20 retention times) were collected to test model applicability. Ensemble sampling was applied in preprocessing to address data imbalance. The RT‑Ensemble Pred model showed higher predictive accuracy than models without sampling and could predict metabolites not included in the database as well as metabolites from new chromatographic systems. A downloadable tool of RT‑Ensemble Pred is available at https://gitlab.com/mikic93/rt‑ensemble‑pred.

RT-Pred	RT		Yes	High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) together with mass spectrometry (MS) is routinely used to separate, identify and quantify chemicals. HPLC data also provides retention time (RT) which can be aligned with structural data. Recent developments in machine learning (ML) have improved our ability to predict RTs from known or postulated chemical structures, allowing RT data to be used more effectively in LC-MS-based compound identification. However, RT data is highly specific to each chromatographic method (CM) and hundreds of different CMs with interdependent parameters are used in separations. This has limited the application of ML-based RT predictions in compound identification. Here we introduce an easy-to-use RT prediction webserver (called RT-Pred) that predicts RTs for molecules across most chromatographic setups. RT-Pred not only supports its own in-house CM-specific RT predictors, it allows users to easily train a custom RT-Pred model using their own RT data on their own CM and to predict RTs with that custom model. RT-Pred also supports RT and compound searches against its own database of millions of predicted RTs spanning >40 different CMs. RT-Pred is also uniquely capable of accurately identifying compounds that will elute in the void volume or be retained on the column. Including this void/retained/eluted classifier significantly improves RT-Pred's performance. Tests indicate that RT-Pred had an average coefficient of determination (R²) of 0.95 over 20 different CMs. Comparisons of RT-Pred against other RT predictors showed that RT-Pred achieved lower mean absolute errors and higher R² scores than any other published RT predictor.

RT-Transformer	RT		Yes	Motivation  Liquid chromatography retention times prediction can assist in metabolite identification, which is a critical task and challenge in nontargeted metabolomics. However, different chromatographic conditions may result in different retention times for the same metabolite. Current retention time prediction methods lack sufficient scalability to transfer from one specific chromatographic method to another. Results  Therefore, we present RT-Transformer, a novel deep neural network model coupled with graph attention network and 1D-Transformer, which can predict retention times under any chromatographic methods. First, we obtain a pre-trained model by training RT-Transformer on the large small molecule retention time dataset containing 80 038 molecules, and then transfer the resulting model to different chromatographic methods based on transfer learning. When tested on the small molecule retention time dataset, as other authors did, the average absolute error reached 27.30 after removing not retained molecules. Still, it reached 33.41 when no samples were removed. The pre-trained RT-Transformer was further transferred to 5 datasets corresponding to different chromatographic conditions and fine-tuned. According to the experimental results, RT-Transformer achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods. In addition, RT-Transformer was applied to 41 external molecular retention time datasets. Extensive evaluations indicate that RT-Transformer has excellent scalability in predicting retention times for liquid chromatography and improves the accuracy of metabolite identification.

MetaPhenotype	Single cell metabolomics			Single-cell mass spectrometry (SCMS) is an emerging tool for studying cell heterogeneity according to variation of molecular species in single cells. Although it has become increasingly common to employ machine learning models in SCMS data analysis, such as the classification of cell phenotypes, the existing machine learning models often suffer from low adaptability and transferability. In addition, SCMS studies of rare cells can be restricted by limited number of cell samples. To overcome these limitations, we performed SCMS analyses of melanoma cancer cell lines with two phenotypes (i.e., primary and metastatic cells). We then developed a meta-learning-based model, MetaPhenotype, that can be trained using a small amount of SCMS data to accurately classify cells into primary or metastatic phenotypes. Our results show that compared with standard transfer learning models, MetaPhenotype can rapidly predict and achieve a high accuracy of over 90% with fewer new training samples. Overall, our work opens the possibility of accurate cell phenotype classification based on fewer SCMS samples, thus lowering the demand for sample acquisition.

MMEASE	Single cell metabolomics			Metabolomics is essential for providing an overview of what chemical processes are taking place. A clear shift from bulk metabolomics to single-cell metabolomics (SCM) is observed in current research, and an integral workflow enabling the analysis of SCM data is therefore in great demand. However, no such workflow has been available to date. Herein, MMEASE, previously designed for analyzing bulk metabolomic data, was therefore updated to its 2.0 version by developing the first comprehensive and in-depth workflow analyzing SCM data. First, it provided all sequential steps of modern SCM research (from SCM data processing, to cellular heterogeneity analysis, then to high-resolution metabolite annotation, and finally to cell-based biological interpretation). Second, compared with the existing tools, MMEASE 2.0 was superior by incorporating the widest variety of methods at every step of the SCM analyses. The originality and functionality of our MMEASE were extensively validated and explicitly described by case studies on benchmark data. All in all, MMEASE 2.0 was unique in accomplishing comprehensive and in-depth analyses of SCM data, which could be considered as an indispensable complement to the existing tools.

scFUMES 	Single cell metabolomics			Alzheimer's disease (AD) exhibits metabolic heterogeneity; yet, the consequences on metabolic dynamics in a cell-type-specific manner and the underlying metabolite-sensor network basis remain unclear. Here, we show that neurons exhibit a striking decrease in energy and lipid-related metabolic activity, contrasted by an increase in microglial metabolism associated with neuroinflammation. To identify brain cell-type specific master metabolic regulators underlying the metabolic alterations of AD, we introduce scFUMES (single cell FUnctional MEtabolite-Sensor), an algorithm integrating single-cell RNA sequencing, interactomics (protein-protein interactions), genomics, transcriptomics, and metabolomics from large human brain biobanks. Applied to two AD-vulnerable regions (middle temporal gyrus and dorsolateral prefrontal cortex), scFUMES uncovers hundreds of AD-associated regulators, with neurons and microglia showing the most interactions. Particularly, scFUMES pinpoints genetics-informed master metabolic regulators across AD severity, sex and APOE genotype (e.g., PPARD-glycerol in microglia). Experimental testing reveals that two interaction pairs predicted by scFUMES, neuronal palmitic acid bound fatty acid binding protein 3 and gut metabolite indole-3-propionic acid binding to kynurenine aminotransferase 1, both lower pathological tau species in AD. In summary, scFUMES identifies cell type-specific master metabolic regulators, offering insights into cellular metabolic heterogeneity and metabolism-targeted therapeutic strategies for AD and neurodegenerative diseases if broadly applied.

SCMeTA	Single cell metabolomics			Summary  To address the challenges in single-cell metabolomics (SCM) research, we have developed an open-source Python-based modular library, named SCMeTA, for SCM data processing. We designed standardized pipeline and inter-container communication format and have developed modular components to adapt to the diverse needs of SCM studies. The validation was carried out on multiple SCM experiment data. The results demonstrated significant improvements in batch effects, accuracy of results, metabolic extraction rate, cell matching rate, as well as processing speed. This library is of great significance in advancing the practical application of SCM analysis and makes a foundation for wide-scale adoption in biological studies.

scSpaMet	Spatial Metabolomics		Yes	Metabolic reprogramming in cancer and immune cells occurs to support their increasing energy needs in biological tissues. Here we propose Single Cell Spatially resolved Metabolic (scSpaMet) framework for joint protein-metabolite profiling of single immune and cancer cells in male human tissues by incorporating untargeted spatial metabolomics and targeted multiplexed protein imaging in a single pipeline. We utilized the scSpaMet to profile cell types and spatial metabolomic maps of 19507, 31156, and 8215 single cells in human lung cancer, tonsil, and endometrium tissues, respectively. The scSpaMet analysis revealed cell type-dependent metabolite profiles and local metabolite competition of neighboring single cells in human tissues. Deep learning-based joint embedding revealed unique metabolite states within cell types. Trajectory inference showed metabolic patterns along cell differentiation paths. Here we show scSpaMet’s ability to quantify and visualize the cell-type specific and spatially resolved metabolic-protein mapping as an emerging tool for systems-level understanding of tissue biology. The authors developed a framework for joint protein-metabolite profiling at the single-cell level in human tissue combining targeted multiplexed protein imaging and untargeted spatial metabolomics in a single pipeline.

SMAnalyst	Spatial Metabolomics			Spatial metabolomics is a rapidly advancing field offering powerful insights into metabolic heterogeneity in biological tissues. However, its widespread adoption is hindered by fragmented tools and the lack of comprehensive, open-source GUI software covering the full analytical workflow (quality control, preprocessing, identification, pattern, and differential analysis). To address this, we developed SManalyst, an open-source, integrated web-based platform. SManalyst consolidates core functionalities, including multi-dimensional data quality assessment (background consistency, noise, intensity, missing values), a comprehensive metabolite annotation scoring system (mass accuracy, isotopic similarity, adduct evidence), and dual-dimension spatial pattern discovery (metabolite co-expression and pixel clustering). It also offers flexible differential analysis (cluster- or user-defined regions). With its intuitive GUI and modular workflow, SManalyst significantly lowers the analysis barrier. Tested with a mouse brain dataset, SManalyst efficiently handles large-scale data (e.g., >14,000 pixels, >3,000 ion peaks), effectively filling a critical gap in integrated analytical solutions for spatial metabolomics. The platform is freely accessible at https://metax.genomics.cn/app/smanalyst.

SMART	Spatial Metabolomics			Spatially resolved metabolomics plays a critical role in unraveling tissue-specific metabolic complexities. Despite its significance, this profound technology generates thousands of features, yet accurate annotation significantly lags behind that of LC-MS-based approaches. To bridge this gap, we introduce SMART, an open-source platform designed for precise formula assignment in mass spectrometry imaging. SMART constructs a KnownSet database containing 2.8 million formulas linked by ChemEdges derived from repositories such as HMDB, ChEMBL, PubChem, and BioEdges from KEGG biological reactant pairs. Using a multiple linear regression model, SMART extracts formula networks associated with the m/z of interest and scores potential candidates based on several criteria, including linked formulas, database existence score, ChemEdges/BioEdges, and ppm values. Benchmarking against reference data sets demonstrates that SMART achieves prediction accuracy rates of up to 95.8%. Applied to mass spectrometry imaging, SMART successfully annotated 986 formulas in developing mouse embryos. This robust platform enables systematic formula annotation within tissues, enhancing our understanding of metabolic heterogeneity.

SMQVP	Spatial Metabolomics			Background: Spatial metabolomics is a powerful technique that enables spatially resolved mapping of metabolite distributions at the tissue and cellular levels, providing valuable insights into biological processes. However, challenges in data quality control and preprocessing remain significant bottlenecks, critically impacting the reliability of downstream analyses and the robustness of findings. Methods: To address these limitations, we present Spatial Metabolomics data Quality Visualization and Processing (SMQVP v1.0), a novel software with a user-friendly graphical interface designed for the systematic quality assessment and preprocessing of spatial metabolomics data. SMQVP incorporates eight comprehensive quality visualization and evaluation modules, including background consistency assessments, noise ion filtering, intensity distribution analyses, and the identification of isotopic and adduct ions. Results: We demonstrated SMQVP’s effectiveness using AFADESI-based mouse brain data, showing that the tool successfully identified and removed noise signals. This rigorous preprocessing resulted in improved clustering outcomes that more accurately reflected the underlying tissue morphology compared with analyses performed on unprocessed data. Conclusions: SMQVP is the first systematic approach focused on quality visualization, specifically for spatial metabolomics. It offers researchers an accessible and comprehensive solution for enhancing data integrity and mitigating the impact of technical noise, thereby improving the reliability and robustness of their spatial metabolomics findings.

SpaMTP	Spatial Metabolomics			The ability to spatially measure multi-modal data provides an unprecedented opportunity to comprehensively explore molecular regulation at transcriptional, translational and metabolic levels to acquire insights on cellular activities underpinning health and disease. However, there is currently a lack of analytical tools to integrate complementary information across different spatial-omics data modalities, particularly with respect to spatial metabolomics data, which is becoming increasingly invaluable. We introduce SpaMTP, a versatile software that implements an end-to-end integrative analysis of spatial metabolomics and transcriptomics data. Based in R, SpaMTP bridges processing functionalities for metabolomics data from Cardinal with user-friendly cell-centric analyses implemented in Seurat. Furthermore, SpaMTP’s comprehensive analysis pipeline covers (1) automated mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) metabolite annotation; (2) a wide range of metabolite-gene based downstream statistical analyses including differential expression, pathway analysis, and correlation analysis; (3) integrative spatial-omics analysis; and (4) a suite of visualisation functions. For flexibility and interoperability, SpaMTP includes various functions for data import/export and object conversion, enabling seamless integration with other R and Python packages. We demonstrated the utility of SpaMTP to draw new biological understandings through analysing two biological system. We believe this software and implemented methods will be broadly utilised in spatial multi-omics and spatial metabolomics analyses.

BioPKS Pipeline, RetroTide 	Specialized			Synthetic biology offers the promise of manufacturing chemicals more sustainably than petrochemistry. Yet, both the rate at which biomanufacturing can synthesize these molecules and the net chemical accessible space are limited by existing pathway discovery methods which can often rely on arduous literature searches. Here, we present an automated retrobiosynthesis tool, BioPKS Pipeline, that simultaneously tackles both problems by integrating multifunctional type I polyketide synthases (PKSs) with monofunctional enzymes to propose the synthesis of desired target chemicals via two new tools: DORAnet and RetroTide. While monofunctional enzymes are valuable for carefully decorating a substrate’s carbon backbone, they typically cannot expand the backbone itself. PKSs can, instead, predictably do this through their unique ability to catalyze carbon-carbon bond formation reactions iteratively. We have evaluated the performance of BioPKS Pipeline against a previously published set of 155 molecules of interest for biomanufacturing, and report that BioPKS Pipeline could produce exact designs for 93 of them, as well as pipelines to a chemically similar product for most of the remaining molecules. Furthermore, BioPKS Pipeline successfully proposes biosynthetic routes for complex therapeutic natural products (cryptofolione and basidalin) for which no known biosynthetic pathway currently exists.

BitterMasS	Specialized		Yes	Bitter compounds are common in nature and among drugs. Previously, machine learning tools were developed to predict bitterness from the chemical structure. However, known structures are estimated to represent only 5–10% of the metabolome, and the rest remain unassigned or “dark”. We present BitterMasS, a Random Forest classifier that was trained on 5414 experimental mass spectra of bitter and nonbitter compounds, achieving precision = 0.83 and recall = 0.90 for an internal test set. Next, the model was tested against spectra newly extracted from the literature 106 bitter and nonbitter compounds and for additional spectra measured for 26 compounds. For these external test cases, BitterMasS exhibited 67% precision and 93% recall for the first and 58% accuracy and 99% recall for the second. The spectrum–bitterness prediction strategy was more effective than the spectrum–structure–bitterness prediction strategy and covered more compounds. These encouraging results suggest that BitterMasS can be used to predict bitter compounds in the metabolome without the need for structural assignment of individual molecules.

BreathXplorer	Specialized			Nontargeted breath analysis in real time using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) is a promising approach for high coverage profiling of metabolites in human exhaled breath. However, the information-rich and unique non-Gaussian metabolic signal shapes of real-time HRMS-based data pose a significant challenge for efficient data processing. This work takes a typical real-time HRMS technique as an example, i.e. secondary electrospray ionization high-resolution mass spectrometry (SESI-HRMS), and presents BreathXplorer, an open-source Python package designed for the processing of real-time exhaled breath data comprising multiple exhalations. BreathXplorer is composed of four main modules. The first module applies either a topological algorithm or a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to determine the start and end points of each exhalation. Next, density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) is employed to cluster m/z values belonging to the same metabolic feature, followed by applying an intensity relative standard deviation (RSD) filter to extract real breath metabolic features. BreathXplorer also offers functions of (1) feature alignment across the samples and (2) associating MS/MS spectra with their corresponding metabolic features for downstream compound annotation. Manual inspection of the metabolic features extracted from SESI-HRMS breath data suggests that BreathXplorer can achieve 100% accuracy in identifying the start and end points of each exhalation and acquire accurate quantitative measurements of each breath feature. In a proof-of-concept study on exercise breathomics using SESI-HRMS, BreathXplorer successfully reveals the significantly changed metabolites that are pertinent to exercise. BreathXplorer is publicly available on GitHub (https://github.com/HuanLab/breathXplorer). It provides a powerful and convenient-to-use tool for the researchers to process breathomics data obtained by directly analysis using HRMS.

ChemEcho	Specialized		Yes	A significant bottleneck in metabolomics data interpretation is the effective use of domain knowledge to assign structural information based on fragmentation patterns. The mass spectrometry query language (MassQL) aims to make this process accessible and applicable across multiple analysis platforms. While advanced computational methods are capable of predicting compound structures from fragmentation data, AI/ML approaches often rely on complex, opaque criteria that are difficult to interpret or modify. As a result, their predictive patterns cannot be readily translated into human-readable rules, such as those used in MassQL. In this study, we introduce ChemEcho, a machine learning embedding method that converts tandem mass spectrometry data into sparse feature vectors containing peak and neutral mass subformulae to enhance explainable AI/ML-based methods. An advantage of this approach is that decision trees trained using these feature vectors can be directly translated to MassQL. Using a battery of decision trees trained using ChemEcho embeddings to predict molecular attributes, we generated over 1500 MassQL queries for 765 molecular features and evaluated their precision and recall. From these queries, the 50 highest-performing queries were integrated into the MassQL compendium. This set of generated MassQL queries included environmentally and biologically relevant classes such as PFAS and molecules containing phosphate or sulfate substructures. To illustrate the impact these queries would have on a typical metabolomics experiment, these MassQL queries were applied to a public metabolomics data set─resulting in a marked increase in the structural information derived from tandem mass spectra. Access and reuse of these queries is expected to enhance structural annotation in untargeted experiments, leading to more specific claims and advancing many applications in metabolomics.

COMMIT	Specialized			Composition and functions of microbial communities affect important traits in diverse hosts, from crops to humans. Yet, mechanistic understanding of how metabolism of individual microbes is affected by the community composition and metabolite leakage is lacking. Here, we first show that the consensus of automatically generated metabolic reconstructions improves the quality of the draft reconstructions, measured by comparison to reference models. We then devise an approach for gap filling, termed COMMIT, that considers metabolites for secretion based on their permeability and the composition of the community. By applying COMMIT with two soil communities from the Arabidopsis thaliana culture collection, we could significantly reduce the gap-filling solution in comparison to filling gaps in individual reconstructions without affecting the genomic support. Inspection of the metabolic interactions in the soil communities allows us to identify microbes with community roles of helpers and beneficiaries. Therefore, COMMIT offers a versatile fully automated solution for large-scale modelling of microbial communities for diverse biotechnological applications.

FORUM	Specialized			Motivation  Metabolomics studies aim at reporting a metabolic signature (list of metabolites) related to a particular experimental condition. These signatures are instrumental in the identification of biomarkers or classification of individuals, however their biological and physiological interpretation remains a challenge. To support this task, we introduce FORUM: a Knowledge Graph (KG) providing a semantic representation of relations between chemicals and biomedical concepts, built from a federation of life science databases and scientific literature repositories. Results  The use of a Semantic Web framework on biological data allows us to apply ontological-based reasoning to infer new relations between entities. We show that these new relations provide different levels of abstraction and could open the path to new hypotheses. We estimate the statistical relevance of each extracted relation, explicit or inferred, using an enrichment analysis, and instantiate them as new knowledge in the KG to support results interpretation/further inquiries. Availability and implementation  A web interface to browse and download the extracted relations, as well as a SPARQL endpoint to directly probe the whole FORUM KG, are available at https://forum-webapp.semantic-metabolomics.fr.

GlyKAn AZ	Specialized			Abstract   Background   Glycosylation is an important modification to proteins that plays a significant role in biological processes. Glycan structures are characterized by liquid chromatography (LC) combined with mass spectrometry (MS), but data interpretation of LC/MS and MS/MS data can be time-consuming and arduous when analyzed manually. Most of glycan analysis requires dedicated glycobioinformatics tools to process MS data, identify glycan structure, and display the results. However, software tools currently available are either too costly or heavily focused on academic applications, limiting their use within the biopharmaceutical industry for implementing the standardized LC/MS glycan analysis in high-throughput manner. Additionally, few tools provide the capability to generate report-ready annotated MS/MS glycan spectra.      Results   Here, we present a MATLAB-based app, GlyKAn AZ, which can automate data processing, glycan identification, and customizable result displays in a streamlined workflow. MS1 and MS2 mass search algorithms along with glycan databases were developed to confirm the fluorescent labeled N-linked glycan species based on accurate mass. A user-friendly graphical user interface (GUI) streamlines the data analysis process, making it easy to implement the software tool in biopharmaceutical analytical laboratories. The databases provided with the app can be expanded through the Fragment Generator functionality which automatically identifies fragmentation patterns for new glycans. The GlyKAn AZ app can automatically annotate the MS/MS spectra, yet this data display feature remains flexible and customizable by users, saving analysts’ time in generating individual report-ready spectra figures. This app accepts both OrbiTrap and matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization–time of flight (MALDI–TOF) MS data and was successfully validated by identifying all glycan species that were previously identified manually.      Conclusions   The GlyKAn AZ app was developed to expedite glycan analysis while maintaining a high level of accuracy in positive identifications. The app’s customizable user inputs, polished figures and tables, and unique calculated outputs set it apart from similar software and greatly improve the current manual analysis workflow. Overall, this app serves as a tool for streamlining glycan identification for both academic and industrial needs.

HCMMD	Specialized			Metabolomics is a rapidly expanding field in systems biology used to measure alterations of metabolites and identify metabolic biomarkers in response to disease processes. The discovery of metabolic biomarkers can improve early diagnosis, prognostic prediction, and therapeutic intervention for cancers. However, there are currently no databases that provide a comprehensive evaluation of the relationship between metabolites and cancer processes. In this review, we summarize reported metabolites in body fluids across pan-cancers and characterize their clinical applications in liquid biopsy. We conducted a search for metabolic biomarkers using the keywords (“metabolomics” OR “metabolite”) AND “cancer” in PubMed. Of the 22,254 articles retrieved, 792 were deemed potentially relevant for further review. Ultimately, we included data from 573,300 samples and 17,083 metabolic biomarkers. We collected information on cancer types, sample size, the human metabolome database (HMDB) ID, metabolic pathway, area under the curve (AUC), sensitivity and specificity of metabolites, sample source, detection method, and clinical features were collected. Finally, we developed a user-friendly online database, the Human Cancer Metabolic Markers Database (HCMMD), which allows users to query, browse, and download metabolite information. In conclusion, HCMMD provides an important resource to assist researchers in reviewing metabolic biomarkers for diagnosis and progression of cancers.

IonFlow	Specialized			Abstract   Introduction   Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) experiments generate complex multi-dimensional data sets that require specialist data analysis tools.

Methods   IonFlow is a Galaxy tool written in R for ionomics data analysis and is freely accessible at https://github.com/wanchanglin/ionflow. It is designed as a pipeline that can process raw data to enable exploration and interpretation using multivariate statistical techniques and network-based algorithms, including principal components analysis, hierarchical clustering, relevance network extraction and analysis, and gene set enrichment analysis.      Results and Conclusion   The pipeline is described and tested on two benchmark data sets of the haploid S. Cerevisiae ionome and of the human HeLa cell ionome.

M2S	Specialized			Integration of multiple datasets can greatly enhance bioanalytical studies, for example, by increasing power to discover and validate biomarkers. In liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) metabolomics, it is especially hard to combine untargeted datasets since the majority of metabolomic features are not annotated and thus cannot be matched by chemical identity. Typically, the information available for each feature is retention time (RT), mass-to-charge ratio (m/z), and feature intensity (FI). Pairs of features from the same metabolite in separate datasets can exhibit small but significant differences, making matching very challenging. Current methods to address this issue are too simple or rely on assumptions that cannot be met in all cases. We present a method to find feature correspondence between two similar LC–MS metabolomics experiments or batches using only the features’ RT, m/z, and FI. We demonstrate the method on both real and synthetic datasets, using six orthogonal validation strategies to gauge the matching quality. In our main example, 4953 features were uniquely matched, of which 585 (96.8%) of 604 manually annotated features were correct. In a second example, 2324 features could be uniquely matched, with 79 (90.8%) out of 87 annotated features correctly matched. Most of the missed annotated matches are between features that behave very differently from modeled inter-dataset shifts of RT, MZ, and FI. In a third example with simulated data with 4755 features per dataset, 99.6% of the matches were correct. Finally, the results of matching three other dataset pairs using our method are compared with a published alternative method, metabCombiner, showing the advantages of our approach. The method can be applied using M2S (Match 2 Sets), a free, open-source MATLAB toolbox, available at https://github.com/rjdossan/M2S.

MassQL	Specialized			Despite being information rich, the vast majority of untargeted mass spectrometry data are underutilized; most analytes are not used for downstream interpretation or reanalysis after publication. The inability to dive into these rich raw mass spectrometry datasets is due to the limited flexibility and scalability of existing software tools. Here we introduce a new language, the Mass Spectrometry Query Language (MassQL), and an accompanying software ecosystem that addresses these issues by enabling the community to directly query mass spectrometry data with an expressive set of user-defined mass spectrometry patterns. Illustrated by real-world examples, MassQL provides a data-driven definition of chemical diversity by enabling the reanalysis of all public untargeted metabolomics data, empowering scientists across many disciplines to make new discoveries. MassQL has been widely implemented in multiple open-source and commercial mass spectrometry analysis tools, which enhances the ability, interoperability and reproducibility of mining of mass spectrometry data for the research community.

MEISTER	Specialized			Spatial omics technologies can reveal the molecular intricacy of the brain. While mass spectrometry imaging (MSI) provides spatial localization of compounds, comprehensive biochemical profiling at a brain-wide scale in three dimensions by MSI with single-cell resolution has not been achieved. We demonstrate complementary brain-wide and single-cell biochemical mapping using MEISTER, an integrative experimental and computational mass spectrometry (MS) framework. Our framework integrates a deep-learning-based reconstruction that accelerates high-mass-resolving MS by 15-fold, multimodal registration creating three-dimensional (3D) molecular distributions and a data integration method fitting cell-specific mass spectra to 3D datasets. We imaged detailed lipid profiles in tissues with millions of pixels and in large single-cell populations acquired from the rat brain. We identified region-specific lipid contents and cell-specific localizations of lipids depending on both cell subpopulations and anatomical origins of the cells. Our workflow establishes a blueprint for future development of multiscale technologies for biochemical characterization of the brain. MEISTER is an integrative experimental and computational framework for mass spectrometry that integrates three-dimensional, organ-wide biomolecular mapping with single-cell analysis for multiscale profiling of spatial–biochemical organization.

MetCohort	Specialized			Liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS)-based untargeted metabolomics is becoming increasingly popular in large-scale cohort studies. However, its data processing is complex and challenging. We present MetCohort, a computational tool for performing metabolomics raw data alignment for large-scale sample analysis, and accurate feature detection and quantification. By combining chromatogram profile alignment and local anchor matching with an outlier removal algorithm, the retention times of the raw data were aligned. With aligned retention times across all the samples, regions of interest (ROIs) are detected and stacked among samples to form a two-dimensional (2D) ROI-matrix. This 2D ROI-matrix, resembling an image with rows representing samples and columns corresponding to the time, allows the application of image processing techniques. Since the peaks are already aligned in the alignment step, features can be accurately detected and quantified with automatic correspondence of all the samples. Based on the 2D image processing technique, holistic scale feature detection is performed, which not only significantly decreases the number of false-positives and improves the detection of low-intensity compounds, but also avoids tricky peak matching and quantification uncertainty. Overall, MetCohort has potential to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of data processing in large-scale LC-HRMS.

Multipass CCS Refiner	Specialized			In this paper, we present the Multipass CCS Refiner, an R application for calibrating multipass collision cross section (CCS) measurements with cyclic ion mobility spectrometry (cIMS). The Multipass CCS Refiner combines the necessary tools for calculating accurate CCS measurements from multipass cIMS experiments into a user-friendly web-based Shiny interface accessible regardless of programming knowledge. The application provides a suite of functions for calculating accurate arrival times, automated pass counting approximation, correction of arrival time perturbations during separation, constructing calibration curves unique to specific instrument settings, separating fine mobility features, and a variety of visualization tools. Code for the application is structured to be easily modified to meet the user’s needs. The Multipass CCS Refiner implements the calibration approach described by Lin and Costello to reduce the need for carefully selected separation times while accounting for artifacts underlying fluctuations in measured ion arrival times. The application is showcased with downloadable data files of commonly used standards, which can be run in the app directly or edited with user experimental data.

NPFimg	Specialized			We present a method named NPFimg, which automatically identifies multivariate chemo-/biomarker features of analytes in chromatography–mass spectrometry (MS) data by combining image processing and machine learning. NPFimg processes a two-dimensional MS map (m/z vs retention time) to discriminate analytes and identify and visualize the marker features. Our approach allows us to comprehensively characterize the signals in MS data without the conventional peak picking process, which suffers from false peak detections. The feasibility of marker identification is successfully demonstrated in case studies of aroma odor and human breath on gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC–MS) even at the parts per billion level. Comparison with the widely used XCMS shows the excellent reliability of NPFimg, in that it has lower error rates of signal acquisition and marker identification. In addition, we show the potential applicability of NPFimg to the untargeted metabolomics of human breath. While this study shows the limited applications, NPFimg is potentially applicable to data processing in diverse metabolomics/chemometrics using GC–MS and liquid chromatography–MS. NPFimg is available as open source on GitHub (http://github.com/poomcj/NPFimg) under the MIT license.

ptairMS	Specialized			Motivation Analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in exhaled breath by proton transfer reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometry (PTR-TOF-MS) is of increasing interest for real-time, non-invasive diagnosis, phenotyping and therapeutic drug monitoring in the clinics. However, there is currently a lack of methods and software tools for the processing of PTR-TOF-MS data from cohorts and suited for biomarker discovery studies. Results  We developed a comprehensive suite of algorithms that process raw data from patient acquisitions and generate the table of feature intensities. Notably, we included an innovative two-dimensional peak deconvolution model based on penalized splines signal regression for accurate estimation of the temporal profile and feature quantification, as well as a method to specifically select the VOCs from exhaled breath. The workflow was implemented as the ptairMS software, which contains a graphical interface to facilitate cohort management and data analysis. The approach was validated on both simulated and experimental datasets, and we showed that the sensitivity and specificity of the VOC detection reached 99% and 98.4%, respectively, and that the error of quantification was below 8.1% for concentrations down to 19 ppb.

SMITER	Specialized			SMITER (Synthetic mzML writer) is a Python-based command-line tool designed to simulate liquid-chromatography-coupled tandem mass spectrometry LC-MS/MS runs. It enables the simulation of any biomolecule amenable to mass spectrometry (MS) since all calculations are based on chemical formulas. SMITER features a modular design, allowing for an easy implementation of different noise and fragmentation models. By default, SMITER uses an established noise model and offers several methods for peptide fragmentation, and two models for nucleoside fragmentation and one for lipid fragmentation. Due to the rich Python ecosystem, other modules, e.g., for retention time (RT) prediction, can easily be implemented for the tailored simulation of any molecule of choice. This facilitates the generation of defined gold-standard LC-MS/MS datasets for any type of experiment. Such gold standards, where the ground truth is known, are required in computational mass spectrometry to test new algorithms and to improve parameters of existing ones. Similarly, gold-standard datasets can be used to evaluate analytical challenges, e.g., by predicting co-elution and co-fragmentation of molecules. As these challenges hinder the detection or quantification of co-eluents, a comprehensive simulation can identify and thus, prevent such difficulties before performing actual MS experiments. SMITER allows the creation of such datasets easily, fast, and efficiently.

SpecPCM	Specialized			Mass spectrometry (MS) is essential for proteomics and metabolomics but faces impending challenges in efficiently processing the vast volumes of data. This paper introduces SpecPCM, an in-memory computing (IMC) accelerator designed to achieve substantial improvements in energy and delay efficiency for both MS spectral clustering and database (DB) search. SpecPCM employs analog processing with low-voltage swing and utilizes recently introduced phase change memory (PCM) devices based on superlattice materials, optimized for low-voltage and low-power programming. Our approach integrates contributions across multiple levels: application, algorithm, circuit, device, and instruction sets. We leverage a robust hyperdimensional computing (HD) algorithm with a novel dimension-packing method and develop specialized hardware for the end-to-end MS pipeline to overcome the non-ideal behavior of PCM devices. We further optimize multi-level PCM devices for different tasks by using different materials. We also perform a comprehensive design exploration to improve energy and delay efficiency while maintaining accuracy, exploring various combinations of hardware and software parameters controlled by the instruction set architecture (ISA). SpecPCM, with up to three bits per cell, achieves speedups of up to 82x and 143x for MS clustering and DB search tasks, respectively, along with a four-orders-of-magnitude improvement in energy efficiency compared with state-of-the-art CPU/GPU tools.

Umatrix	Specialized			Small sample sizes in biomedical research often led to poor reproducibility and challenges in translating findings into clinical applications. This problem stems from limited study resources, rare diseases, ethical considerations in animal studies, costly expert diagnosis, and others. As a contribution to the problem, we propose a novel generative algorithm based on self-organizing maps (SOMs) to computationally increase sample sizes. The proposed unsupervised generative algorithm uses neural networks to detect inherent structure even in small multivariate datasets, distinguishing between sparse “void” and dense “cloud” regions. Using emergent SOMs (ESOMs), the algorithm adapts to high-dimensional data structures and generates for each original data point k new points by randomly selecting positions within an adapted hypersphere with distances based on valid neighborhood probabilities. Experiments on artificial and biomedical (omics) datasets show that the generated data preserve the original structure without introducing artifacts. Random forests and support vector machines cannot distinguish between generated and original data, and the variables of original and generated data sets are not statistically different. The method successfully augments small group sizes, such as transcriptomics data from a rare form of leukemia and lipidomics data from arthritis research. The novel ESOM-based generative algorithm presents a promising solution for enhancing sample sizes in small or rare case datasets, even when limited training data are available. This approach can address challenges associated with small sample sizes in biomedical research, offering a tool for improving the reliability and robustness of scientific findings in this field.

VIMMS 2.0	Specialized			The choice of fragmentation strategies used during mass-spectrometry-based data acquisition directly affects the quality and coverage of subsequent structural identification – a crucial step in untargeted metabolomics data analysis. However, developing novel fragmentation strategies is challenging due to the high experimental cost of running an actual mass spectrometry instrument and the lack of a programmable simulation environment to support their development. ViMMS 2.0 is a software framework that can be used to develop new fragmentation strategies in metabolomics completely in-silico as well as on mass spectrometry instruments. The framework allows users to generate chemical objects (produced synthetically or extracted from existing mzML files) and simulate a tandem mass spectrometry process, where different fragmentation strategies can be rapidly implemented, tested and evaluated. In this paper, we present ViMMS 2.0, highlighting the software design choices of the framework and illustrate with an example how a new fragmentation strategy could be implemented in ViMMS 2.0	ViMMS 2.0: A framework to develop, test and optimise fragmentation strategies in LC-MS metabolomics	https://joss.theoj.org/papers/10.21105/joss.03990	Journal of Open Source Software	Wandy, J., Davies, V., McBride, R., Weidt, S., Rogers, S., & Daly, R.

DarkNPS	Specialized		Yes	Over the past decade, the illicit drug market has been reshaped by the proliferation of clandestinely produced designer drugs. These agents, referred to as new psychoactive substances (NPSs), are designed to mimic the physiological actions of better-known drugs of abuse while skirting drug control laws. The public health burden of NPS abuse obliges toxicological, police and customs laboratories to screen for them in law enforcement seizures and biological samples. However, the identification of emerging NPSs is challenging due to the chemical diversity of these substances and the fleeting nature of their appearance on the illicit market. Here we present DarkNPS, a deep learning-enabled approach to automatically elucidate the structures of unidentified designer drugs using only mass spectrometric data. Our method employs a deep generative model to learn a statistical probability distribution over unobserved structures, which we term the structural prior. We show that the structural prior allows DarkNPS to elucidate the exact chemical structure of an unidentified NPS with an accuracy of 51% and a top-10 accuracy of 86%. Our generative approach has the potential to enable de novo structure elucidation for other types of small molecules that are routinely analysed by mass spectrometry.

DNA Adduct Portal	Spectral Library			Endogenous electrophiles, ionizing and non-ionizing radiation, and hazardous chemicals present in the environment and diet can damage DNA by forming covalent adducts. DNA adducts can form in critical cancer driver genes and, if not repaired, may induce mutations during cell division, potentially leading to the onset of cancer. The detection and quantification of specific DNA adducts are some of the first steps in studying their role in carcinogenesis, the physiological conditions that lead to their production, and the risk assessment of exposure to specific genotoxic chemicals. Hundreds of different DNA adducts have been reported in the literature, and there is a critical need to establish a DNA adduct mass spectral database to facilitate the detection of previously observed DNA adducts and characterize newly discovered DNA adducts. We have collected synthetic DNA adduct standards from the research community, acquired MSn (n = 2, 3) fragmentation spectra using Orbitrap and Quadrupole-Time-of-Flight (Q-TOF) MS instrumentation, processed the spectral data and incorporated it into the MassBank of North America (MoNA) database, and created a DNA adduct portal Web site (https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/dnaadductportal) to serve as a central location for the DNA adduct mass spectra and metadata, including the spectral database downloadable in different formats. This spectral library should prove to be a valuable resource for the DNA adductomics community, accelerating research and improving our understanding of the role of DNA adducts in disease.

EMBL-MCF 2.0	Spectral Library			Abstract   Introduction   Over the past two decades, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics has experienced significant growth, playing a crucial role in various scientific disciplines. However, despite these advance-ments, metabolite identification (MetID) remains a significant challenge. To address this, stringent MetID requirements were established, emphasizing the necessity of aligning experimental data with authentic reference standards using multiple criteria. Establishing dependable methods and corresponding libraries is crucial for instilling confidence in MetID and driving further progress in metabolomics.      Objective   The EMBL-MCF 2.0 LC-MS/MS method and public library was designed to facilitate both targeted and untargeted metabolomics with exclusive focus on endogenous, polar metabolites, which are known to be challenging to analyze due to their hydrophilic nature. By accompanying spectral data with robust retention times obtained from authentic standards and low-adsorption chromatography, high confidence MetID is achieved and accessible to the metabolomics community.      Methods   The library is built on hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and state-of-the-art low adsorption LC hardware. Both high-resolution tandem mass spectra and manually optimized multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) transitions were acquired on an Orbitrap Exploris 240 and a QTRAP 6500+, respectively.      Results   Implementation of biocompatible HILIC has facilitated the separation of isomeric metabolites with significant enhancements in both selectivity and sensitivity. The resulting library comprises a diverse collection of more than 250 biologically relevant metabolites. The methodology was successfully applied to investigate a variety of biological matrices, with exemplary findings showcased using murine plasma samples.      Conclusions   Our work has resulted in the development of the EMBL-MCF 2.0 library, a powerful resource for sensitive metabolomics analyses and high-confidence MetID.

GNPS Drug Library	Spectral Library			Despite extensive efforts, extracting medication exposure information from clinical records remains challenging. To complement this approach, here we show the Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) Drug Library, a tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) based resource designed for drug screening with untargeted metabolomics. This resource integrates MS/MS references of drugs and their metabolites/analogs with standardized vocabularies on their exposure sources, pharmacologic classes, therapeutic indications, and mechanisms of action. It enables direct analysis of drug exposure and metabolism from untargeted metabolomics data, supporting flexible summarization at multiple ontology levels to align with different research goals. We demonstrate its application by stratifying participants in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) cohort based on detected drug exposures. We uncover drug-associated alterations in microbiota-derived N-acyl lipids that are not captured when stratifying by self-reported medication use. Overall, GNPS Drug Library provides a scalable resource for empirical drug screening in clinical, nutritional, environmental, and other research disciplines, facilitating insights into the ecological and health consequences of drug exposures. While not intended for immediate clinical decision-making, it supports data-driven exploration of drug exposures where traditional records are limited or unreliable.

HighResNPS	Spectral Library		Yes	Objective The number of new psychoactive substances (NPS) continues to grow with 950 analogues currently monitored by the European Drug Agency (EUDA, formerly the EMCDDA). Although the number of new analogues reported each year is on a decline, it remains a problem for laboratories who are trying to keep analytical methods up to date. Furthermore, maintaining contemporary collections of certified reference materials (CRMs) for screening and confirmation also requires significant financial investment. Suspect screening involves interrogating mass spectrometry data using databases/libraries of typically externally acquired information such as precursor and product ion data. It allows laboratories to maintain a wide scope of testing without the need to purchase every certified material available and rather it can be used in the intelligence-driven acquisition of CRMs for confirmation. HighResNPS (highresnps.com) is an online crowd-sourced mass spectral (MS) database for new psychoactive substances (NPS). It was developed by the Section of Forensic Chemistry at the University of Copenhagen who maintained this resource until its transfer to TIAFT in October 2023 and now overseen by the TIAFT NPS Committee. Methods The HighResNPS database was developed using the ASP.NET web framework and operates off a central table which contains all entries in the database. Users can contribute to this database either manually through the web interface, or by importing their compounds using the Microsoft Excel template provided on registration. The entire database is also provided as a Consensus library, which reduces the database to only one entry per unique compound. This entry contains the product ions that were observed for that compound across all entries and are scored based on their frequency. The Consensus library is then made available for download in 7 formats compatible with software from most instrument vendors. Deep learning, using different algorithms, were developed to improve the suspect screening capabilities of the database including retention time prediction, MS/MS spectral prediction and prophetic NPS structure determination. Results As of November 2024, HighResNPS has a total of 7204 entries corresponding to 2348 unique compounds, mostly comprised of NPS and their metabolites. Product ion data is available for 1706 compounds. HighResNPS has continued to show steady growth in users, with a total of 501 users from 50 countries (compared to 129 users at the start of 2020). Membership comprises mainly forensic toxicology laboratories, but also wastewater-based epidemiology, customs and illicit drug analysis laboratories. The retention time prediction model and associated personalised databases are active for 25 user methods. HighResNPS has collaborated with leading researchers in the field of artificial intelligence (AI). Firstly, the generative model, DarkNPS, was able to generate a library of over 8 million structures, with many compounds of the top predicted compounds appearing on the market. Secondly, a web server was developed to give users a graphical user interface for the MS/MS prediction model, NPS-MS (nps-ms.ca), providing a means for users to predict MS/MS spectra at 10, 20 and 40 eV. Discussion The implementation of retention time prediction feature allows these laboratories to apply HighResNPS in suspect screening contexts more efficiently and has facilitated the detection of NPS outside routine targeted testing. Strategies to incorporate these initiatives into the HighResNPS database are being investigated with a new and improved website to be released in 2025. Conclusion HighResNPS continues to be a premier resource for suspect screening of NPS and has been recognised as such by being made a perpetual resource by TIAFT. With continuing projects in the AI space and a new platform anticipated to be released in 2025, the value of HighResNPS is only expected to increase.

In silico infrared spectral library of human metabolites	Spectral Library			Infrared ion spectroscopy (IRIS) continues to see increasing use as an analytical tool for small-molecule identification in conjunction with mass spectrometry (MS). The IR spectrum of an m/z selected population of ions constitutes a unique fingerprint that is specific to the molecular structure. However, direct translation of an IR spectrum to a molecular structure remains challenging, as reference libraries of IR spectra of molecular ions largely do not exist. Quantum-chemically computed spectra can reliably be used as reference, but the challenge of selecting the candidate structures remains. Here, we introduce an in silico library of vibrational spectra of common MS adducts of over 4500 compounds found in the human metabolome database. In total, the library currently contains more than 75,000 spectra computed at the DFT level that can be queried with an experimental IR spectrum. Moreover, we introduce a database of 189 experimental IRIS spectra, which is employed to validate the automated spectral matching routines. This demonstrates that 75% of the metabolites in the experimental data set are correctly identified, based solely on their exact m/z and IRIS spectrum. Additionally, we demonstrate an approach for specifically identifying substructures by performing a search without m/z constraints to find structural analogues. Such an unsupervised search paves the way toward the de novo identification of unknowns that are absent in spectral libraries. We apply the in silico spectral library to identify an unknown in a plasma sample as 3-hydroxyhexanoic acid, highlighting the potential of the method.

MassBank	Spectral Library			The open spectral library MassBank (https://massbank.jp/) started in 2006 in Japan, as one of the first open source and open access cross-vendor mass spectral libraries. The first dedicated European MassBank server (https://massbank.eu/) was launched in 2011, adding spectra from compounds of environmental relevance to complement the original metabolomics focus. Recent developments boosted the FAIRness of MassBank data, and a redesigned web interface with modern architecture was launched in 2025. All records are under version control, and versioned releases are pushed to an independent data repository with digital object identifier assigned to each data release. Semantic metadata integrates the spectral data into the world of linked open data. The record format enables many downstream studies, and records are validated by an automated pipeline to ensure data quality upon submission and review existing records. The SPectraL hASH was added for spectral content-based access. MassBank is cross-integrated in several resources such as MassBank of North America, Global Natural Product Social Molecular Networking, PubChem, the US EPA CompTox Dashboard, NORMAN Database System, RforMassSpectrometry, and more. MassBank now boasts a total of 119 845 spectra of 18 529 compounds from 53 contributors from around the world.

metScribeR	Spectral Library			One persistent challenge in untargeted metabolomics is the identification of compounds from their mass spectrometry (MS) signal, which is necessary for biological data interpretation. This process can be facilitated by building in-house libraries of metabolite standards containing retention time (RT) information, which is orthogonal and complementary to large, published MS/MS spectra repositories. Creating such libraries can require substantial effort and is time intensive. To streamline this process, we developed metScribeR, an R package with a Shiny application to accelerate the creation of RT and m/z libraries. metScribeR provides an easy, user-friendly interface for peak finding, filtering, and comprehensive quality review of the MS data. Uniquely, metScribeR does not require MS/MS spectral information and reports an identification probability estimate for each adduct. In our benchmarking, metScribeR required approximately 10 s of computational and manual effort per standard, showed a correlation of 0.99 between manual and metScribeR-derived RTs, and appropriately filtered out poor quality peaks. The metScribeR output is a.csv file including the identity, m/z, RT, and peak quality information for standards along with MS/MS spectra retrieved from MassBank of North America (MoNA). metScribeR is open source and available for download on GitHub at https://github.com/ncats/metScribeR	metScribeR: A semiautomated tool for data processing of in-house LC–MS metabolite reference libraries	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acs.jproteome.5c00548	Journal of Proteome Research	Tisch, A.

mFAM	Spectral Library			The analysis of metabolic profiles using high resolution mass spectrometry (MS) data gives deep insights into the biological processes. In metabolomics, MS generates a large number of features that represent metabolites. However, identifying specific metabolites from these features can be challenging. One of the major bottlenecks in the metabolomics field is the identification of MS features, which is a prerequisite for any biochemical interpretation. By identifying similarities and differences within a family, evaluating MS features at the metabolite family level can help assign functional roles to individual MS features. This data can help interpret metabolic pathways and processes within a biological system. For the assignment of metabolite families to MS features, it is very important to have good quality, reliable, and diverse spectral libraries. We initiated a global effort to collect high-resolution MS/MS spectra of metabolites from all biological origins, including mammals, microorganisms, and plants. The mFAM-MS/MS Collection delivers valuable training data to assign machine-readable classified information on the unknown metabolites. The mFam Consortium used a standardized metadata template and has developed a globally curated MS/MS spectral library of 7,872 spectra with 2,126 unique metabolites. This library was compiled from 47 datasets contributed by 25 laboratories and leverages 12 instrument types, including QTOF, Orbitrap, and Ion Mobility systems. It comprises 4,646 spectra in positive mode and 3,226 in negative mode. This standardized resource significantly enhances metabolite identification capabilities, supports the development of machine learning-based annotation tools, and accelerates the discovery of novel metabolites. All spectra are available under the collective contributor label mFam in the MassBank system, including the web interface and the 2025.10 data release available at GitHub and Zenodo.

MIADB	Spectral Library			In less than 10 years, molecular networking (MN) strategy has revolutionized the art of Natural Products (NP) isolation to enter a rational workflow greatly increasing the probabilities of isolating new chemical entities. To pinpoint and streamline the isolation of new Monoterpene Indole Alkaloids (MIAs) in producing plants, we rendered publicly available the MIA database (MIADB), comprising MS2 data for ca. 200 structurally diverse MIA, by uploading it to the Global Natural Products Social Molecular Networking (GNPS) platform. Here, we describe the key experimental aspects underlying data collection, data curation, and their subsequent upload to the GNPS libraries as a database. Practical tips are also provided at the end of this chapter to help optimizing the efficiency of the dereplication of MIA-containing plants against the MIADB-implemented GNPS library.

MS2extrcat	Spectral Library			Reference MS/MS libraries are useful to aid in metabolomics compound identification. However, creating these libraries can be challenging because of the complexity of MS/MS data handling, the need for manual spectrum inspection, and requirement for custom-designed bioinformatics tools for this purpose. Although licensed and open-source alternatives to create MS/MS reference libraries exist, most of these pipelines require manual extraction of each reference spectrum, which is a time-consuming and error-prone process. Here, we present MS2extract, an R package facilitating the user-led creation and automation of MS/MS spectral libraries. The core MS2extract workflow consists of importing MS/MS raw data, detecting specific precursor ions, extracting MS/MS spectra, removing low-intensity signals, and exporting a spectral database. In addition, libraries created with MS2extract are compatible with GNPS2 batch upload to maximize MS/MS library reuse. We used MS2extract to create PhenolicsDB, a phenolics-focused MS/MS library with fragmentation patterns of 71 authentic analytical standards collected in positive and negative polarity, and multiple collision energies, with 320 MS/MS reference spectra. Finally, we employed PhenolicsDB to identify apple fruit phenolics. MS2extract and PhenolicsDB are free and publicly available for download and use, and PhenolicsDB is also available in GNPS2.

PASL	Spectral Library			This Data Descriptor reports the submission of a High-Resolution Orbitrap Mass Spectral Library of Pyrrolizidine Alkaloids (PASL) to public repositories. The library contains 165 tandem mass spectra (MS/MS) from 84 pyrrolizidine alkaloid (PA) standards, along with 18 additional PAs manually annotated in crude plant extracts. This collection comprises most commercially available PAs and a unique selection of annotated (in crude extracts) and synthesized compounds. The PASL serves as a valuable resource for identifying PAs in complex mixtures without analytical standards and facilitates the annotation of novel PAs through molecular networking approach. To ensure high quality, the library was validated by dereplicating its spectra against the GNPS libraries and applying it to the annotation of two PA-producing plant species. The spectra of the PASL can be accessed through GNPS (https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/gnpslibrary.jsp?library=PYRROLIZIDINE-ALKALOID-SPECTRAL-LIBRARY), with accession numbers ranging from CCMSLIB00014205782 to CCMSLIB00014205946. The PASL in .mgf format can be downloaded from GNPS under: https://external.gnps2.org/gnpslibrary. The PASL enables rapid and straightforward annotation of both known and novel PAs, accelerating research in food safety and related fields.

UCL-MetIsoLib	Spectral Library			We present UCL-MetIsoLib, a publicly accessible high-resolution tandem mass spectrometry (HRMS/MS) library developed for HILIC-based, ion-pairing-free, isomer-resolved metabolomics using a bioinert UHPLC system and the Acquity Premier BEH Amide column. The platform integrates two complementary methods operating under distinct chromatographic conditions (pH 3.5, ESI+; pH 11.0, ESI-), enabling broad metabolic coverage. A total of 334 metabolites are annotated in the library structure, with thiol derivatization incorporated into the extraction protocol to mitigate redox-driven artifacts. Metabolite identification is supported by 245 authentic reference standards and curated according to MSI Level 1 and Level 2 criteria. Validation followed FDA guidelines for bioanalytical method validation across five biological matrices─urine, plasma, tissues, cells, and patient-derived colorectal organoids. The method demonstrated high precision (<15% RSD intra/inter-day) and recovery (85-115% across all QC levels). To demonstrate biological applicability, UCL-MetIsoLib was applied to a case study comparing healthy and colorectal cancer-derived organoids. The method enabled confident annotation of metabolite isomers, including key glycolytic intermediates such as DHAP and GA3P, as well as sugar phosphates from the glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathways. Metabolic alterations were observed in tumor organoids, including accumulation of nucleotide derivatives and shifts in central carbon metabolism. The library is constantly under expansion and is freely available in its latest version at: https://github.com/kserafimov10/UCLMetIsoLib.

WFSR Food Safety Mass Spectral Library 	Spectral Library			Spectral library searching is a key method for compound annotation in mass spectrometry; however, existing libraries often suffer from high data heterogeneity, varying spectral quality, or limited accessibility. These issues are particularly significant in food safety, where the lack of comprehensive reference data hampers the identification of hazardous compounds. To address these limitations, we developed the WFSR Food Safety Mass Spectral Library, a freely accessible tandem mass spectral library focused on food contaminants, residues, and hazardous compounds. This library contains 6993 manually curated spectra from 1001 compounds acquired in positive ionization mode using ultrahigh-performance liquid chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap IQ-X Tribrid mass spectrometer. Spectra were recorded at seven collision energies under standardized conditions. Comprehensive metadata are provided, including common names, CAS, SMILES, InChIKeys, retention times, and compound classes. The library is publicly available via a dedicated website (https://www.wur.nl/en/show/food-safety-mass-spectral-library.htm) and through the GNPS repository, adhering to FAIR data principles to facilitate community reuse. Comparisons with major repositories (GNPS, MassBank, MoNA, and MSnLib) showed that 216 compounds (22.2%) are unique to our library. Further analysis using molecular networking and MS2Query revealed that about 38% of the compounds lack reliable matches in public libraries. The WFSR spectral library is designed to improve the annotation of food toxicants and facilitate the identification of structural analogues using computational tools. This library is part of an ongoing initiative with future updates planned to include negative ionization mode spectra and an expanded compound repertoire, aiming to advance food safety monitoring.

CIeaD	Spectral Library 			Plant metabolomics faces major challenges in metabolite identification due to the structural diversity of plant metabolites and limited coverage in existing spectral libraries. To address this, we developed CIeaD (Collision-Induced and Electron-Activated Dissociation), an open-access plant metabolite spectral library containing complementary CID and EAD spectra. The library includes curated high-resolution spectra for 2,305 phytochemicals across major metabolite classes, acquired in both positive and negative modes with a dual fragmentation mechanism to capture a wide range of diagnostic ions. CIeaD library is provided in multiple formats and can be accessed at https://www.moleculardetective.org/Links.html.

RMB-mix	Spectral Library 			The term “exposome” is defined as a comprehensive study of life-course environmental exposures and the associated biological responses. Humans are exposed to many different chemicals, which can pose a major threat to the well-being of humanity. Targeted or non-targeted mass spectrometry techniques are widely used to identify and characterize various environmental stressors when linking exposures to human health. However, identification remains challenging due to the huge chemical space applicable to exposomics, combined with the lack of sufficient relevant entries in spectral libraries. Addressing these challenges requires cheminformatics tools and database resources to share curated open spectral data on chemicals to improve the identification of chemicals in exposomics studies. This article describes efforts to contribute spectra relevant for exposomics to the open mass spectral library MassBank (https://www.massbank.eu) using various open source software efforts, including the R packages RMassBank and Shinyscreen. The experimental spectra were obtained from ten mixtures containing toxicologically relevant chemicals from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Non-Targeted Analysis Collaborative Trial (ENTACT). Following processing and curation, 5582 spectra from 783 of the 1268 ENTACT compounds were added to MassBank, and through this to other open spectral libraries (e.g., MoNA, GNPS) for community benefit. Additionally, an automated deposition and annotation workflow was developed with PubChem to enable the display of all MassBank mass spectra in PubChem, which is rerun with each MassBank release. The new spectral records have already been used in several studies to increase the confidence in identification in non-target small molecule identification workflows applied to environmental and exposomics research.

MSident	Specialized	Others		Recent advances in chromatography and mass spectrometry analytical techniques have led to the development of statistical and chemometric workflows for filtering and analyzing the vast amount of data acquired. The ROIMCR method has become increasingly important in data analysis of complex chemical mixtures analyzed by MS chromatographic and imaging analytical methods, such as in the analysis of natural mixtures of biomolecules or emerging environmental contaminants, among others. However, the final interpretation of the results of ROIMCR can be cumbersome and time-consuming, due to the manual filtering of the ROIMCR-resolved species spectra and of their matching within spectral repositories. In this study, we describe the MSident MATLAB app aimed at automatizing two aspects, the MS spectra filtering and their identification processes. MSident has been tested in three real data examples, demonstrating its capability to automatically identify chemical compounds from ROIMCR-resolved spectra using public repositories. These examples cover three types of mass spectrometry acquisition: i) MS1 signals, ii) tandem MS/MS (MS1 and MS2) signals, and iii) both MS1 and MS2 signals when they are acquired in positive and negative ionization modes. In these three cases, MSident successfully identified most of the chemical compounds present in their analyzed mixtures, yielding similar results to those obtained from standard manual searching procedures, but in a more straightforward way and in a shorter time.

cluster-CV	Statistical			Background Metabolomics is a scientific field that relies on the comprehensive analysis of metabolites to provide direct insights into functional processes in biological systems. Metabolomic data provides valuable insights into the functional processes of biological systems, often analyzed through univariate and multivariate approaches, and well as with functional or pathway analysis using different methods such as mummichog. Yet, the integration of results from these sources to aid the interpretation of their biological significance remains challenging. This represents a significant bottleneck limiting the applicability of multivariate analysis of metabolomic data, despite its potential for providing deep biological insights. Results In this work we propose two straightforward methods to facilitate the interpretation of results from multivariate analysis and functional metabolic analysis using: i) p-values from multivariate tests as input in functional analysis, and ii) cluster-CV to assess the impact on the predictive performance of a multivariate model at the pathway level. Four simulated data sets were analyzed including a data set with no class separation, and three data sets with a statistically significant discrimination between classes by including either univariate, multivariate, or both types of discriminant effects. The data sets were analyzed using univariate tests and OPLS-DA. Furthermore, p-values for each feature estimated by univariate analysis and OPLS-DA were used as input for functional analysis in mummichog. Cluster-CV was then used to assess the effect of detected metabolic pathways on the class separation observed by OPLS-DA. Significance Through simulated data, we show how these approaches enhance the interpretation of biological effects driving multivariate models and support the identification of altered pathways not detected by univariate analysis. By providing a deeper understanding of metabolic phenotypes, these methods might improve the biological insights derived from statistical and functional analysis of future or previous studies.

DisCo P-ad	Statistical			Background: Due to scientific advancements in high-throughput data production technologies, omics studies, such as genomics and metabolomics, often give rise to numerous measurements per sample/subject containing several noisy variables that potentially cloud the true signals relevant to the desired study outcome(s). Therefore, correcting for multiple testing is critical while performing any statistical test of significance to minimize the chances of false or missed discoveries. Such correction practice is commonplace in genome-wide association studies (GWAS) but is also becoming increasingly relevant to metabolome-wide association studies (MWAS). However, many existing procedures may be too conservative or too lenient, only assume a linear association between the features, or have not been evaluated on metabolomics data. Methods: One such multiple testing correction strategy is to estimate the number of statistically independent tests, called the effective number of tests, based on the eigen-analysis of the correlation matrix between the features. This effective number is then used for a subsequent single-step adjustment to obtain the pointwise significance level. We propose a modification to the p-value adjustment based on a more general measure of association between two predictors, the distance correlation, with a specific focus on MWAS. Results: We assessed common GWAS p-value adjustment procedures and one tailored for MWAS, which rely on eigen-analysis of the Pearson’s correlation matrix. Our study, including varying sample size-to-feature ratios, response types, and metabolite groupings, highlights the superior performance of the distance correlation. Conclusion: We propose the distance-correlation-based p-value adjustment (DisCo P-ad) as a novel modification that can enhance existing eigen-analysis-based multiple testing correction procedures by increasing power or reducing false positives. While our focus is on metabolomics, DisCo P-ad can also readily be applied to other high-dimensional omics studies.

GetFeatistics	Statistical			Metabolomics studies require complex data processing pipelines to ensure data quality and extract meaningful biological insights. GetFeatistics is an R-package developed to streamline the elaboration and statistical analysis of metabolomics data. For targeted analyses, the package enables calibration curve-based quantification with different data weighting options. For untargeted studies, it includes dedicated functions to import feature tables from tools like patRoon and MS-DIAL, assign annotation confidence levels, and filter features based on pooled quality control (QC) criteria, including options for group-specific pooled QCs. The package also provides functions for univariate and multivariate statistical analyses, notably streamlined regression modelling with fixed effects, mixed-effects models for longitudinal data, and Tobit regression for censoring values exceeding the limits of detection. Output tables are concise and informative, facilitating interpretation and reporting, while output visualisations are fully customisable via the ggplot grammar. Additional functionalities include automated retrieval of chemical properties from PubChem, ontology classification via ClassyFire, and pathway enrichment analysis using the FELLA package. GetFeatistics is publicly available on GitHub, with comprehensive documentation and a step-by-step vignette. By integrating key steps of the metabolomics workflow, the package aims to facilitate both exploratory studies and large-scale epidemiological applications in metabolomics research.

imputomics	Statistical		Yes	Motivation  Missing values are commonly observed in metabolomics data from mass spectrometry. Imputing them is crucial because it assures data completeness, increases the statistical power of analyses, prevents inaccurate results, and improves the quality of exploratory analysis, statistical modeling, and machine learning. Numerous Missing Value Imputation Algorithms (MVIAs) employ heuristics or statistical models to replace missing information with estimates. In the context of metabolomics data, we identified 52 MVIAs implemented across 70 R functions. Nevertheless, the usage of those 52 established methods poses challenges due to package dependency issues, lack of documentation, and their instability. Results  Our R package, ‘imputomics’, provides a convenient wrapper around 41 (plus random imputation as a baseline model) out of 52 MVIAs in the form of a command-line tool and a web application. In addition, we propose a novel functionality for selecting MVIAs recommended for metabolomics data with the best performance or execution time. Availability and implementation  ‘imputomics’ is freely available as an R package (github.com/BioGenies/imputomics) and a Shiny web application (biogenies.info/imputomics-ws).

MAI	Statistical			Abstract When analyzing large datasets from high-throughput technologies, researchers often encounter missing quantitative measurements, which are particularly frequent in metabolomics datasets. Metabolomics, the comprehensive profiling of metabolite abundances, are typically measured using mass spectrometry technologies that often introduce missingness via multiple mechanisms: (1) the metabolite signal may be smaller than the instrument limit of detection; (2) the conditions under which the data are collected and processed may lead to missing values; (3) missing values can be introduced randomly. Missingness resulting from mechanism (1) would be classified as Missing Not At Random (MNAR), that from mechanism (2) would be Missing At Random (MAR), and that from mechanism (3) would be classified as Missing Completely At Random (MCAR). Two common approaches for handling missing data are the following: (1) omit missing data from the analysis; (2) impute the missing values. Both approaches may introduce bias and reduce statistical power in downstream analyses such as testing metabolite associations with clinical variables. Further, standard imputation methods in metabolomics often ignore the mechanisms causing missingness and inaccurately estimate missing values within a data set. We propose a mechanism-aware imputation algorithm that leverages a two-step approach in imputing missing values. First, we use a random forest classifier to classify the missing mechanism for each missing value in the data set. Second, we impute each missing value using imputation algorithms that are specific to the predicted missingness mechanism (i.e., MAR/MCAR or MNAR). Using complete data, we conducted simulations, where we imposed different missingness patterns within the data and tested the performance of combinations of imputation algorithms. Our proposed algorithm provided imputations closer to the original data than those using only one imputation algorithm for all the missing values. Consequently, our two-step approach was able to reduce bias for improved downstream analyses.

MetaboLINK/ PCA-GLASSO 	Statistical			Introduction In the rapidly advancing field of ‘omics research, there is an increasing demand for sophisticated bioinformatic tools to enable efficient and consistent data analysis. As biological datasets, particularly metabolomics, become larger and more complex, innovative strategies are essential for deciphering the intricate molecular and cellular networks.MethodsWe introduce a pioneering analytical approach that combines Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with Graphical Lasso (GLASSO). This method is designed to reduce the dimensionality of large datasets while preserving significant variance. For the first time, we applied the PCA-GLASSO algorithm (i.e., MetaboLINK) to metabolomics data derived from Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy performed on neural cells at various developmental stages, from human embryonic stem cells to neurons.ResultsThe MetaboLINK analysis of longitudinal metabolomics data has revealed distinct pathways related to amino acids, lipids, and energy metabolism, uniquely associated with specific cell progenies. These findings suggest that different metabolic pathways play a critical role at different stages of cellular development, each contributing to diverse cellular functions.DiscussionOur study demonstrates the efficacy of the MetaboLINK approach in analyzing NMR-based longitudinal metabolomic datasets, highlighting key metabolic shifts during cellular transitions. We share the methodology and the code to advance general ‘omics research, providing a powerful tool for dissecting large datasets in neurobiology and other fields.

MetaHD	Statistical			Motivation  Meta-analysis methods widely used for combining metabolomics data do not account for correlation between metabolites or missing values. Within- and between-study variability are also often overlooked. These can give results with inferior statistical properties, leading to misidentification of biomarkers. Results  We propose a multivariate meta-analysis model for high-dimensional metabolomics data (MetaHD), which accommodates the correlation between metabolites, within- and between-study variances, and missing values. MetaHD can be used for integrating and collectively analysing individual-level metabolomics data generated from multiple studies as well as for combining summary estimates. We show that MetaHD leads to lower root mean square error compared to the existing approaches. Furthermore, we demonstrate that MetaHD, which exploits the borrowing strength between metabolites, could be particularly useful in the presence of missing data compared with univariate meta-analysis methods, which can return biased estimates in the presence of data missing at random. Availability and implementation  The MetaHD R package can be downloaded through Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) repository.

MeTEor	Statistical			Motivation The availability of longitudinal omics data is increasing in metabolomics research. Viewing metabolomics data over time provides detailed insight into biological processes and fosters understanding of how systems react over time. However, the analysis of longitudinal metabolomics data poses various challenges, both in terms of statistical evaluation and visualization. Results  To make explorative analysis of longitudinal data readily available to researchers without formal background in computer science and programming, we present MEtabolite Trajectory ExplORer (MeTEor). MeTEor is an R Shiny app providing a comprehensive set of statistical analysis methods. To demonstrate the capabilities of MeTEor, we replicated the analysis of metabolomics data from a previously published study on COVID-19 patients.

MultiClassMetabo	Statistical		Yes	Multiclass metabolomics has become a popular technique for revealing the mechanisms underlying certain physiological processes, different tumor types, or different therapeutic responses. In multiclass metabolomics, it is highly important to uncover the underlying biological information on biosamples by identifying the metabolic markers with the most associations and classifying the different sample classes. The classification problem of multiclass metabolomics is more difficult than that of the binary problem. To date, various methods exist for constructing classification models and identifying metabolic markers consisting of well-established techniques and newly emerging machine learning algorithms. However, how to construct a superior classification model using these methods remains unclear for a given multiclass metabolomic data set. Herein, MultiClassMetabo has been developed for constructing a superior classification model using metabolic markers identified in multiclass metabolomics. MultiClassMetabo can enable online services, including (a) identifying metabolic markers by marker identification methods, (b) constructing classification models by classification methods, and (c) performing a comprehensive assessment from multiple perspectives to construct a superior classification model for multiclass metabolomics. In summary, MultiClassMetabo is distinguished for its capability to construct a superior classification model using the most appropriate method through a comprehensive assessment, which makes it an important complement to other available tools in multiclass metabolomics.

NOREVA	Statistical			A typical output of a metabolomic experiment is a peak table corresponding to the intensity of measured signals. Peak table processing, an essential procedure in metabolomics, is characterized by its study dependency and combinatorial diversity. While various methods and tools have been developed to facilitate metabolomic data processing, it is challenging to determine which processing workflow will give good performance for a specific metabolomic study. NOREVA, an out-of-the-box protocol, was therefore developed to meet this challenge. First, the peak table is subjected to many processing workflows that consist of three to five defined calculations in combinatorially determined sequences. Second, the results of each workflow are judged against objective performance criteria. Third, various benchmarks are analyzed to highlight the uniqueness of this newly developed protocol in (1) evaluating the processing performance based on multiple criteria, (2) optimizing data processing by scanning thousands of workflows, and (3) allowing data processing for time-course and multiclass metabolomics. This protocol is implemented in an R package for convenient accessibility and to protect users’ data privacy. Preliminary experience in R language would facilitate the usage of this protocol, and the execution time may vary from several minutes to a couple of hours depending on the size of the analyzed data.

omicsMIC	Statistical			Mass spectrometry is a powerful and widely used tool for generating proteomics, lipidomics and metabolomics profiles, which is pivotal for elucidating biological processes and identifying biomarkers. However, missing values in mass spectrometry-based omics data may pose a critical challenge for the comprehensive identification of biomarkers and elucidation of the biological processes underlying human complex disorders. To alleviate this issue, various imputation methods for mass spectrometry-based omics data have been developed. However, a comprehensive comparison of these imputation methods is still lacking, and researchers are frequently confronted with a multitude of options without a clear rationale for method selection. To address this pressing need, we developed omicsMIC (mass spectrometry-based omics with Missing values Imputation methods Comparison platform), an interactive platform that provides researchers with a versatile framework to evaluate the performance of 28 diverse imputation methods. omicsMIC offers a nuanced perspective, acknowledging the inherent heterogeneity in biological data and the unique attributes of each dataset. Our platform empowers researchers to make data-driven decisions in imputation method selection based on real-time visualizations of the outcomes associated with different imputation strategies. The comprehensive benchmarking and versatility of omicsMIC make it a valuable tool for the scientific community engaged in mass spectrometry-based omics research. omicsMIC is freely available at https://github.com/WQLin8/omicsMIC. 	omicsMIC: a comprehensive benchmarking platform for robust comparison of imputation methods in mass spectrometry-based omics data	https://academic.oup.com/nargab/article/6/2/lqae071/7693416?login=true	NAR Genomics and Bioinformatics	Lin, W., Ji, J., Su, K.‑J., Qiu, C., Tian, Q., Zhao, L.‑J., Luo, Z., Wu, C., Shen, H., & Deng, H.

PLSKO	Statistical			Motivation: Integrating the knockoff framework with any variable-selection method delivers stringent false discovery rate (FDR) control without recourse to p-values, offering a powerful alternative for differential expression analysis of high-throughput omics datasets. However, existing knockoff generators rely on restrictive modelling assumptions or coarse approximations that often inflate the FDR when applied to real-world data.  Results: We introduce Partial Least Squares Knockoff (PLSKO), an efficient, assumption-free generator that remains robust across diverse omics platforms. Our extensive simulations show that PLSKO is the only method to maintain FDR control with sufficient power in complex non-linear settings. Our semi-simulation studies drawn from RNA-seq, proteomics, metabolomics, and microbiome experiments confirm PLSKO generates valid knockoff variables. In pre-eclampsia multi-omics case studies, we combine PLSKO with Aggregation Knockoff to address the randomness of knockoffs and improve power, and demonstrate the method's ability to recover biologically meaningful features.  Availability and implementation: Our proposed algorithm is available on Github (https://github.com/guannan-yang/PLSKO) and Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16879594).

rMisbeta	Statistical			Transcriptomics and metabolomics data often contain missing values or outliers due to limitations of the data acquisition techniques. Most of the statistical methods require complete datasets for downstream analysis. A number of methods have been developed for missing value imputation using the classical mean and variance based on maximum likelihood estimators, which are not robust against outliers. Consequently, the performance of these methods deteriorates in the presence of outliers. Hence precise imputation of missing values and outliers handling are both concurrently important. Therefore, in this paper, we developed a robust iterative approach using robust estimators based on the minimum beta divergence method, which simultaneously impute missing values and outliers. We investigate the performance of the proposed method in a comparison with six frequently used missing value imputation methods such as Zero, KNN, robust SVD, EM, random forest (RF) and weighted least square approach (WLSA) through feature selection using both simulated and real datasets. Ten performance indices were used to explore the optimal method such as Frobenius norm (FOBN), accuracy (ACC), sensitivity (SN), specificity (SP), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV), detection rate (DR), misclassification error rate (MER), the area under the ROC curve (AUC) and computational runtime. Evaluation based on both simulated and real data suggests the superiority of the proposed method over the other traditional methods in terms of various rates of outliers and missing values. The suggested approach also keeps almost equal performance in absence of outliers with the other methods. The proposed method is accurate, simple, and consumes lower computational time compared to the other methods. Therefore, our recommendation is to apply the proposed procedure for large-scale transcriptomics and metabolomics data analysis. The computational tool has been implemented in an R package, which is publicly available from https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=rMisbeta	rMisbeta: A robust missing value imputation approach in transcriptomics and metabolomics data	https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0010482521007058	Computers in Biology and Medicine	Shahjaman, M., Rahman, M.R., Islam, T., Auwul, M.R., Moni, M.A., Mollah, M.N.H.

SMART 2.0	Statistical			Metabolomics has experienced significant growth and increased popularity due to technological advancements. We introduced an integrated tool for untargeted metabolomics analysis, SMART 1.0, that streamlined the entire analysis process, from initial data preprocessing to subsequent association analysis. With SMART 2.0, we enhanced SMART 1.0 by introducing new analytical modules in targeted metabolomics analysis, data normalization, quality control assessment, and advanced dimensionality reduction and classification methods. Additionally, SMART 2.0 offers integrative omics pathway analysis and postanalysis tasks such as peak identification and concentration calibration. We also explored the potential of using large language models for peak annotation and have found the results to be promising.

SpectraX	Statistical			The analysis of complex spectra is an important component of direct/ambient mass spectrometry (MS) applications such as natural product screening. Unlike chromatography-based metabolomics or proteomics approaches, which rely on software and algorithms, the work of spectral screening is mostly performed manually in the initial stages of research and relies heavily on the experience of the analyst. As a result, throughput and spectral screening reliability are problematic when dealing with large amounts of data. Here, we present SpectraX, a MATLAB-based application, which can analyze MS spectra and quickly locate m/z features from them. Principal component analysis (PCA) is used to analyze the data set, and scoring plots are presented to help in understanding the clustering of data. The algorithm uses mass to charge (m/z) features to produce a list of potential natural products.

wscaling.R	Statistical			Systematic variation is a common issue in metabolomics data analysis. Therefore, different scaling and normalization techniques are used to preprocess the data for metabolomics data analysis. Although several scaling methods are available in the literature, however, choice of scaling, transformation and/or normalization technique influence the further statistical analysis. It is challenging to choose the appropriate scaling technique for downstream analysis to get accurate results or to make a proper decision. Moreover, the existing scaling techniques are sensitive to outliers or extreme values. To fill the gap, our objective is to introduce a robust scaling approach that is not influenced by outliers as well as provides more accurate results for downstream analysis. Here, we introduced a new weighted scaling approach that is robust against outliers however, where no additional outlier detection/treatment step is needed in data preprocessing and also compared it with the conventional scaling and normalization techniques through artificial and real metabolomics datasets. We evaluated the performance of the proposed method in comparison to the other existing conventional scaling techniques using metabolomics data analysis in both the absence and presence of different percentages of outliers. Results show that in most cases, the proposed scaling technique performs better than the traditional scaling methods in both the absence and presence of outliers. The proposed method improves the further downstream metabolomics analysis.

MAMSI	Statistical		Yes	Liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is a commonly used analytical technique in untargeted metabolomics. However, the diverse chemical and physical properties of metabolites often require the use of several different analytical assays for broad metabolome coverage. Conventionally, each assay is analyzed separately, but this fails to capture interassay relationships, making multiassay biomarker discovery and data interpretation difficult. Here we propose a workflow to integrate multiassay metabolomics data, designed to enable biomarker discovery and elucidation of unknown metabolites. We employ a multiblock–partial least-squares model (MB-PLS) coupled with multiblock variable importance in projection to estimate the importance of predictors to the outcome variable. Then we cluster the selected predictors and compare them to groups defined by their structural properties based on retention time and mass-to-charge ratio. To demonstrate and evaluate the approach, we used three multiassay data sets predicting biological sex, Alzheimer’s disease status, and blood bilirubin levels as the outcomes of interest. The MB-PLS models outperformed single-assay models in both classification and regression tasks, indicating that modeling interblock relationships enabled an improved estimate of phenotypic outcome. Additionally, the MB-PLS models shed valuable insight into each data block’s contribution to the predicted outcome. Our workflow enabled us to determine a set of potential cross-assay biomarkers. Following putative annotation, the majority of these and their signs of association agreed with results previously reported in the literature. Our workflow has the potential to benefit the metabolomics community and beyond as it offers interpretable integrative analysis of multiassay LC-MS data and facilitates discovery of potential biomarkers.

PredCMB	Statistical			Motivation  Microbiota-derived metabolites significantly impact host biology, prompting extensive research on metabolic shifts linked to the microbiota. Recent studies have explored both direct metabolite analyses and computational tools for inferring metabolic functions from microbial shotgun metagenome data. However, no existing tool specifically focuses on predicting changes in individual metabolite levels, as opposed to metabolic pathway activities, based on shotgun metagenome data. Understanding these changes is crucial for directly estimating the metabolic potential associated with microbial genomic content. Results  We introduce Predicting Changes in Microbial metaBolites (PredCMB), a novel method designed to predict alterations in individual metabolites between conditions using shotgun metagenome data and enzymatic gene–metabolite networks. PredCMB evaluates differential enzymatic gene abundance between conditions and estimates its influence on metabolite changes. To validate this approach, we applied it to two publicly available datasets comprising paired shotgun metagenomics and metabolomics data from inflammatory bowel disease cohorts and the cohort of gastrectomy for gastric cancer. Benchmark evaluations revealed that PredCMB outperformed a previous method by demonstrating higher correlations between predicted metabolite changes and experimentally measured changes. Notably, it identified metabolite classes exhibiting major alterations between conditions. By enabling the prediction of metabolite changes directly from shotgun metagenome data, PredCMB provides deeper insights into microbial metabolic dynamics than existing methods focused on pathway activity evaluation. Its potential applications include refining target metabolite selection in microbial metabolomic studies and assessing the contributions of microbial metabolites to disease pathogenesis.

CLAW-MRM	Targeted			Lipidomic profiling generates vast datasets, making manual annotation and trend interpretation complex and time-intensive. The structural and chemical diversity of the lipidome further complicates the analysis. While existing tools support targeted lipid identification, they often lack automated workflows and seamless integration with statistical and bioinformatics tools. Here, we introduce the comprehensive lipidomics automated workflow for multiple reaction monitoring (CLAW-MRM), a platform designed to automate lipid annotation, statistical analysis, and data parsing using custom multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) precursor product ion transitions. CLAW-MRM employs trimmed mean of m-value (TMM) normalization to account for lipid load differences, enabling robust cross-sample comparisons. To evaluate CLAW-MRM's performance, we analyzed lipid profiles in liver tissues of Alzheimer's disease (AD) mice and age-matched wild-type controls under conditions of constant and variable tissue mass, assessing the impact of normalization strategies on TMM-normalized lipidomic outcomes. Additionally, we isolated and profiled lipid droplets from individual brain regions of 18- to 24-month-old AD male mice and controls, leveraging nearly 1,500 MRM transitions across 11 lipid classes. Enhancing biological relevance, CLAW-MRM integrates LIGER (lipidome gene enrichment reactions), linking lipid expression with gene activation and suppression patterns. Through CLAW-MRM-based LIGER, we identified metabolic pathways enriched in differentially expressed lipids, offering insights into altered lipid metabolism in AD. To improve usability, CLAW-MRM incorporates a natural language interface powered by large language models, enabling artificial intelligence (AI)-driven user interaction for statistical and bioinformatics analyses. By automating lipid structural identification and integrating AI-assisted bioinformatics, CLAW-MRM provides an end-to-end workflow from data acquisition to interpretation, streamlining high-throughput lipidomics.

MRMPro	Targeted			Abstract  Background   As a gold-standard quantitative technique based on mass spectrometry, multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) has been widely used in proteomics and metabolomics. In the analysis of MRM data, as no peak picking algorithm can achieve perfect accuracy, manual inspection is necessary to correct the errors. In large cohort analysis scenarios, the time required for manual inspection is often considerable. Apart from the commercial software that comes with mass spectrometers, the open-source and free software Skyline is the most popular software for quantitative omics. However, this software is not optimized for manual inspection of hundreds of samples, the interactive experience also needs to be improved.      Results   Here we introduce MRMPro, a web-based MRM data analysis platform for efficient manual inspection. MRMPro supports data analysis of MRM and schedule MRM data acquired by mass spectrometers of mainstream vendors. With the goal of improving the speed of manual inspection, we implemented a collaborative review system based on cloud architecture, allowing multiple users to review through browsers. To reduce bandwidth usage and improve data retrieval speed, we proposed a MRM data compression algorithm, which reduced data volume by more than 60% and 80% respectively compared to vendor and mzML format. To improve the efficiency of manual inspection, we proposed a retention time drift estimation algorithm based on similarity of chromatograms. The estimated retention time drifts were then used for peak alignment and automatic EIC grouping. Compared with Skyline, MRMPro has higher quantification accuracy and better manual inspection support.      Conclusions   In this study, we proposed MRMPro to improve the usability of manual calibration for MRM data analysis. MRMPro is free for non-commercial use. Researchers can access MRMPro through http://mrmpro.csibio.com/. All major mass spectrometry formats (wiff, raw, mzML, etc.) can be analyzed on the platform. The final identification results can be exported to a common.xlsx format for subsequent analysis.

Norm ISWSVR 	Targeted			Targeted quantification metabolomics provides dynamic insights across various domains within the life sciences. Nevertheless, maintaining high-quality data obtained through liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry presents ongoing challenges. It is essential to develop normalization methods to correct for unwanted variations in metabolomic profiling such as batch effects and analytical drift. In this study, we assessed the normalization efficacy of Norm ISWSVR in targeted quantification metabolomics by comparing it with IS normalization and SERRF normalization. Consequently, Norm ISWSVR demonstrated exceptional efficacy in mitigating batch effects and reducing the relative standard deviation of quality control samples, in addition to correcting signal drift. Following normalization with Norm ISWSVR, the number of metabolites suitable for quantification increased with high precision. Collectively, Norm ISWSVR proves to be a robust and reliable method for enhancing data quality in targeted metabolomics, establishing itself as a promising approach for metabolomics research.

RHermes	Targeted			Comprehensive metabolome analyses are essential for biomedical, environmental, and biotechnological research. However, current MS1- and MS2-based acquisition and data analysis strategies in untargeted metabolomics result in low identification rates of metabolites. Here we present HERMES, a molecular-formula-oriented and peak-detection-free method that uses raw LC/MS1 information to optimize MS2 acquisition. Investigating environmental water, Escherichia coli, and human plasma extracts with HERMES, we achieved an increased biological specificity of MS2 scans, leading to improved mass spectral similarity scoring and identification rates when compared with a state-of-the-art data-dependent acquisition (DDA) approach. Thus, HERMES improves sensitivity, selectivity, and annotation of metabolites. HERMES is available as an R package with a user-friendly graphical interface for data analysis and visualization.

SCALiR	Targeted			Quantitative liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC-MS)-based metabolomics is becoming an important approach for studying complex biological systems but presents several technical challenges that limit its widespread use. Computing metabolite concentrations using standard curves generated from standard mixtures of known concentrations is a labor-intensive process that is often performed manually. Currently, there are few options for open-source software tools that can automatically calculate metabolite concentrations. Herein, we introduce SCALiR (standard curve application for determining linear ranges), a new web-based software tool specifically built for this task, which allows users to automatically transform LC-MS signals into absolute quantitative data (https://www.lewisresearchgroup.org/software). SCALiR uses an algorithm that automatically finds the equation of the line of best fit for each standard curve and uses this equation to calculate compound concentrations from the LC-MS signal. Using a standard mix containing 77 metabolites, we show a close correlation between the concentrations calculated by SCALiR and the expected concentrations of each compound (R2 = 0.99 for a y = x curve fitting). Moreover, we demonstrate that SCALiR reproducibly calculates concentrations of midrange standards across ten analytical batches (average coefficient of variation 0.091). SCALiR can be used to calculate metabolite concentrations either using external calibration curves or by using internal standards to correct for matrix effects. This open-source and vendor agnostic software offers users several advantages in that (1) it requires only 10 s of analysis time to compute concentrations of >75 compounds, (2) it facilitates automation of quantitative workflows, and (3) it performs deterministic evaluations of compound quantification limits. SCALiR therefore provides the metabolomics community with a simple and rapid tool that enables rigorous and reproducible quantitative metabolomics studies.

TARDIS	Targeted			In recent years, liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC–MS) has emerged as the main technology to measure the whole of small molecules (the metabolome) in a diversity of matrices. Within the field of computational metabolomics, significant efforts have been made in the development of tools to (pre)process untargeted LC–MS data. However, tools that circumvent the time-consuming, manual preprocessing of targeted LC–MS data with vendor-specific software remain sparse. We therefore present TARDIS, an open-source R package for the analysis of targeted LC–MS metabolomics and lipidomics data. Both established (area under the curve, maximum intensity and points over the peak) and recently developed (custom signal-to-noise ratio and bell-curve similarity) quality metrics were included to offer increased efficiency of peak quality evaluation. The robustness of TARDIS’ peak integration was demonstrated through a quantitative comparison to state-of-the-art vendor software. To this end, applicability at a large scale (n = 1786) was validated across three distinct biofluids (stool, saliva and urine) and two LC–MS instruments, using data from the FAME, ENVIRONAGE, and FGFP cohort studies. In conclusion, TARDIS offers a robust and scalable open-source solution for the targeted analysis of LC–MS metabolomics and lipidomics data. TARDIS and its source code are freely available at https://github.com/UGent-LIMET/TARDIS.

automRm	Targeted 		Yes	Preprocessing of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) raw data facilitates downstream statistical and biological data analyses. In the case of targeted LC-MS data, consistent recognition of chromatographic peaks is a main challenge, in particular, for low abundant signals. Fully automatic preprocessing is faster than manual peak review and does not depend on the individual operator. Here, we present the R package automRm for fully automatic preprocessing of LC-MS data recorded in MRM mode. Using machine learning (ML) for detection of chromatographic peaks and quality control of reported results enables the automatic recognition of complex patterns in raw data. In addition, this approach renders automRm generally applicable to a wide range of analytical methods including hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC), which is known for sample-to-sample variations in peak shape and retention time. We demonstrate the impact of the choice of training data set, of the applied ML algorithm, and of individual peak characteristics on automRm’s ability to correctly report chromatographic peaks. Next, we show that automRm can replicate results obtained by manual peak review on published data. Moreover, automRm outperforms alternative software solutions regarding the variation in peak integration among replicate measurements and the number of correctly reported peaks when applied to a HILIC-MS data set. The R package is freely available from gitlab (https://gitlab.gwdg.de/joerg.buescher/automrm).	automRm: An R Package for Fully Automatic LC-QQQ-MS Data Preprocessing Powered by Machine Learning	https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acs.analchem.1c05224	Analytical Chemistry	Eilertz, D., Mitterer, M., & Buescher, J.

MRMQuant	Targeted 			Multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) is a powerful and popular technique used for metabolite quantification in targeted metabolomics. Accurate and consistent quantitation of metabolites from the MRM data is essential for subsequent analyses. Here, we developed an automated tool, MRMQuant, for targeted metabolomic quantitation using high-throughput liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry MRM data to provide users with an easy-to-use tool for accurate MRM data quantitation with minimal human intervention. This tool has many user-friendly functions and features to inspect and correct the quantitation results as required. MRMQuant possesses the following features to ensure accurate quantitation: (1) dynamic signal smoothing, (2) automatic deconvolution of coeluted peaks, (3) absolute quantitation via standard curves and/or internal standards, (4) visualized inspection and correction, (5) corrections applicable to multiple samples, and (6) batch-effect correction.

ClusterApp 	Visualization			Background Clustering analysis is a foundational step in exploratory data analysis workflows, with dimensionality reduction methods commonly used to visualize multidimensional data in lower-dimensional spaces and infer sample clustering. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is widely applied in metabolomics but is often suboptimal for clustering visualization. Metabolomics data often require specialized manipulations such as blank removal, quality control adjustments, and data transformations that demand efficient visualization tools. However, the lack of user-friendly tools for clustering without computational expertise presents a challenge for metabolomics researchers. ClusterApp addresses this gap as a web application that performs Principal Coordinate Analysis (PCoA), expanding clustering alternatives in metabolomics. Built on a QIIME 2 Docker image, it enables PCoA computation and Emperor plot visualization. The app supports data input from GNPS, GNPS2, or user-provided spreadsheets. Freely available, ClusterApp can be locally installed as a Docker image or integrated into Jupyter Notebook, offering accessibility and flexibility to diverse users. Results To demonstrate the data preprocessing techniques available in ClusterApp, we analyzed two Liquid Chromatography coupled to Tandem Mass Spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics datasets: one exploring metabolomic differences in mouse tissue samples and another investigating coral life history stages. Among the dissimilarity measures available, the Bray-Curtis measure effectively highlighted key metabolomic variations and patterns across both datasets. Targeted filtering significantly enhanced data reliability by retaining biologically relevant features, 10,617 in the coral dataset and 7,341 in the mouse dataset while eliminating noise. The combination of Total Ion Current (TIC) normalization and auto-scaling improved clustering resolution, revealing distinct separations in tissue types and life stages. ClusterApp’s flexible features, such as customizable blank removal and group selection, provided tailored analyses, enhancing visualization and interpretation of metabolomic profiles. Conclusion ClusterApp addresses the need for accessible, dynamic tools for exploratory data analysis in metabolomics. By coupling data transformation capabilities with PCoA on multiple dissimilarity matrices, it provides a versatile solution for clustering analysis. Its web interface and Docker-based deployment offer flexibility, accommodating a wide range of use cases through graphical or programmatic interactions. ClusterApp empowers researchers to uncover meaningful patterns and relationships in metabolomics data without requiring cumbersome data manipulation or advanced bioinformatics expertise.

lcmsWorld	Visualization			Complex biological samples, in particular, in proteomics and metabolomics research, are often analyzed using mass spectrometry paired with liquid chromatography or gas chromatography. The chromatography stage adds a third dimension (retention time) to the usual 2D mass spectrometry output (mass/charge, detected ion counts). Experimental results are often discovered by complex computational analysis, but it is not always possible to know if the data has been correctly interpreted. To perform quality-control checks, it can often be helpful to verify the results by manually examining the raw data, and it is typically easier to understand the data in a graphical, rather than numerical, form. 3D graphics hardware is present in most modern computers but is rarely utilized by bioinformatics software, even when the data to be viewed are naturally 3D. lcmsWorld is new software that uses graphics hardware to quickly and smoothly examine and compare LC-MS data. A preprocessing step allows the software to subsequently access any area of the data instantly at multiple levels of detail. The data can then be freely navigated while the software automatically selects, loads, and displays the most appropriate detail. lcmsWorld is open source.

MODE	Visualization			Studies generating transcriptomics, proteomics, lipidomics, and metabolomics (colloquially referred to as "omics") data allow researchers to find biomarkers or molecular targets or understand complex biological structures and functions by identifying changes in biomolecule abundance and expression between experimental conditions. Omics data are multidimensional, and oftentimes summarization techniques such as principal component analysis (PCA) are used to identify high-level patterns in data. Though useful, these summaries do not allow exploration of detailed patterns in omics data that may have biological relevance. The use of interactive HTML displays with plots allows researchers to interact with omics data at a detailed level, but building these displays requires significant coding expertise. To overcome this barrier, the software MODE was built to empower users to build their own interactive HTML displays to support scientific discovery. These displays are easily shareable, do not depend on a specific operating system, and allow users to sort and filter plots by categorical or numerical variables called metas. MODE allows users to build and share these displays with several options for plot design and meta selection. The MODE web application and its capabilities are presented and then demonstrated on lipidomics data from a leaf wounding study.

PathwayNexus	Visualization			Motivation High-throughput omics methods increasingly result in large datasets including metabolomics data, which are often difficult to analyse. Results To help researchers to handle and analyse those datasets by mapping and investigating metabolomics data of multiple sampling conditions (e.g. different time points or treatments) in the context of pathways, PathwayNexus has been developed, which presents the mapping results in a matrix format, allowing users to easily observe the relations between the compounds and the pathways. It also offers functionalities like ranking, sorting, clustering, pathway views, and further analytical tools. Its primary objective is to condense large sets of pathways into smaller, more relevant subsets that align with the specific interests of the user. Availability and implementation The methodology presented here is implemented in PathwayNexus, an open-source add-on for Vanted available at www.cls.uni-konstanz.de/software/pathway-nexus.

RAIChU	Visualization			Natural products are molecules that fulfil a range of important ecological functions. Many natural products have been exploited for pharmaceutical and agricultural applications. In contrast to many other specialised metabolites, the products of modular nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) and polyketide synthase (PKS) systems can often (partially) be predicted from the DNA sequence of the biosynthetic gene clusters. This is because the biosynthetic pathways of NRPS and PKS systems adhere to consistent rulesets. These universal biosynthetic rules can be leveraged to generate biosynthetic models of biosynthetic pathways. While these principles have been largely deciphered, software that leverages these rules to automatically generate visualisations of biosynthetic models has not yet been developed. To enable high-quality automated visualisations of natural product biosynthetic pathways, we developed RAIChU (Reaction Analysis through Illustrating Chemical Units), which produces depictions of biosynthetic transformations of PKS, NRPS, and hybrid PKS/NRPS systems from predicted or experimentally verified module architectures and domain substrate specificities. RAIChU also boasts a library of functions to perform and visualise reactions and pathways whose specifics (e.g., regioselectivity, stereoselectivity) are still difficult to predict, including terpenes, ribosomally synthesised and posttranslationally modified peptides and alkaloids. Additionally, RAIChU includes 34 prevalent tailoring reactions to enable the visualisation of biosynthetic pathways of fully maturated natural products. RAIChU can be integrated into Python pipelines, allowing users to upload and edit results from antiSMASH, a widely used BGC detection and annotation tool, or to build biosynthetic PKS/NRPS systems from scratch. RAIChU’s cluster drawing correctness (100%) and drawing readability (97.66%) were validated on 5000 randomly generated PKS/NRPS systems, and on the MIBiG database. The automated visualisation of these pathways accelerates the generation of biosynthetic models, facilitates the analysis of large (meta-) genomic datasets and reduces human error. RAIChU is available at https://github.com/BTheDragonMaster/RAIChU and https://pypi.org/project/raichu.

RDD metabolomics platform	Visualization			Untargeted tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS)-based metabolomics enables broad characterization of small molecules in complex samples, yet the majority of spectra in a typical experiment remain unannotated, limiting biological interpretation. Reference data-driven (RDD) metabolomics addresses this gap by contextualizing spectra through comparison to curated, metadata-annotated reference datasets, allowing inference of spectrum origins without requiring exact structural identification. Here, we present an open-source RDD metabolomics platform comprising a user-friendly web application and a Python software package that perform RDD analyses directly from molecular networking outputs generated by GNPS. The tools support visualization and statistical analysis of RDD results, including interactive bar plots, heat maps, principal component analysis, and Sankey diagrams. We illustrate the approach using a hierarchical reference dataset of 3,500 food items to derive dietary patterns from stool metabolomics data of omnivore and vegan participants. The analysis reveals clear dietary group separation, demonstrating how RDD metabolomics can extract biologically meaningful patterns from otherwise unannotated spectra. Thus, the RDD metabolomics platform removes technical barriers for the metabolomics community to adopting reference data-driven analysis, with the functionality freely available at https://github.com/bittremieuxlab/gnps-rdd and https://gnps-rdd.streamlit.app/.

SpecXplore	Visualization			Untargeted metabolomics promises comprehensive characterization of small molecules in biological samples. However, the field is hampered by low annotation rates and abstract spectral data. Despite recent advances in computational metabolomics, manual annotations and manual confirmation of in-silico annotations remain important in the field. Here, exploratory data analysis methods for mass spectral data provide overviews, prioritization, and structural hypothesis starting points to researchers facing large quantities of spectral data. In this research, we propose a fluid means of dealing with mass spectral data using specXplore, an interactive Python dashboard providing interactive and complementary visualizations facilitating mass spectral similarity matrix exploration. Specifically, specXplore provides a two-dimensional t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding embedding as a jumping board for local connectivity exploration using complementary interactive visualizations in the form of partial network drawings, similarity heatmaps, and fragmentation overview maps. SpecXplore makes use of state-of-the-art ms2deepscore pairwise spectral similarities as a quantitative backbone while allowing fast changes of threshold and connectivity limitation settings, providing flexibility in adjusting settings to suit the localized node environment being explored. We believe that specXplore can become an integral part of mass spectral data exploration efforts and assist users in the generation of structural hypotheses for compounds of interest.
